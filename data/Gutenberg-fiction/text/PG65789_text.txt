                            DUPLICATE STITCH

This is the stitch used most often for embroidering a desired motif on a
knitted article. It is worked by: * bringing needle through center of
stitch from the wrong side to right side of work—see ill. A. Following
the outline of the knit stitch above, draw the yarn across the back of
the two strands of this stitch—see ill. A and B—return needle to the
center of the same stitch—see ill. B—and draw yarn through. Repeat from
* starting next stitch by bringing needle through center of stitch to be
duplicated—see ill. C.
