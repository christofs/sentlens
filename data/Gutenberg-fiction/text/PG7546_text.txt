aggressively truthful

one's life

Affections will not be bidden

Beginning to grow old with touching courage

Book that they are content to know at
second hand

Christianity had done nothing to improve morals
and conditions

Clemens was sole, incomparable, the Lincoln of
our literature

Comfort from the thought that most things cannot
be helped

Contemptible he found our pseudo-equality

Critical vanity and self-righteousness

Critics are in no sense the legislators of
literature

Despair broke in laughter

Dickens rescued Christmas from Puritan distrust

Didn't reason about their beliefs, but
only argued

Disbeliever in punishments of all sorts

Even a day's rest is more than most people
can bear

Everlasting rock of human credulity and folly

Exchanging inaudible banalities

Fear of asking too much and the folly of asking
too little

For most people choice is a curse

Forbear the excesses of analysis

Gift of waiting for things to happen

Got out of it all the fun there was in it

Government is best which governs least

Habit of saying some friendly lying thing

He was not bored because he would not be

He had no time to make money

He's so resting

He's the same kind of a man that he was a boy

Heighten our suffering by anticipation

Heroic lies

His readers trusted and loved him

I do not think any man ought to live by an art

If one were poor, one ought to be deserving

If he was half as bad, he would have been too
bad to be

Incredible in their insipidity

Industrial slavery

Lewd literature seems to give a sanction to
lewdness in the life

Lie, of course, and did to save others from
grief or harm

Life alone is credible to the young

Livy: Well, if you are to be lost, I want to be
lost with you

Livy Clemens: the loveliest person I have
ever seen

Luxury of helplessness

Married Man: after the first start-off he
don't try

goes for less

Old man's disposition to speak of his
infirmities

Pathetic hopefulness

Plain-speaking or Rude Speaking

Praised it enough to satisfy the author

Pseudo-realists

Public wish to be amused rather than edified

Real artistocracy is above social prejudice

Reformers, who are so often tedious and
ridiculous

Refused to see us as we see ourselves

Shackles of belief worn so long

She liked to get all she could out of her
emotions

Society interested in a woman's past,
not her future

Teach what they do not know

Somewhat too studied grace

Sunny gayety of self-forgetfulness

Secretly admires the splendors he affects to
despise

Self-satisfied, intolerant, and hypocritical
provinciality

Submitted, as people always do with the trials
of others

Tediously analytical

They are so many and I am so few

Truth is beyond invention

Used to ingratitude from those he helped

Vacuous vulgarity

We did not know that we were poor

We're company enough for ourselves

What we thought ruin, but what was really
release

When she's really sick, she's better

Wonder why we hate the past so?--"It's so
damned humiliating!"

You can't go back to anything

You may do a great deal (of work), and not get on

You marry a man's future as well as his past

You cannot be at perfect ease with a friend who
does not joke
