EXTRACT FROM PEPYS’ DIARY.


TAKES LESSONS IN POLITICAL ECONOMY.

“He showed me a very excellent argument, to prove that our importing
less than we export does not impoverish the kingdom, according to the
received opinion: which, though it be a paradox, and that I do not
remember the argument, yet methought there was a great deal in what he
said.” (Feb., 1664.)

“He also made me fully understand that the old law of prohibiting
bullion to be exported is, and ever was, a folly and injury rather than
good. Arguing thus, that if the exportations exceed the importations,
then the balance must be brought home in money, which, when our
merchants know cannot be carried out again, they will forbear to bring
home in money, but let it lie abroad for trade, or keep in foreign
banks; or, if our importations exceed our exportations, then to keep
credit the merchants will and must find ways of carrying out money by
stealth, which is a most easy thing to do, and is everywhere done, and
therefore the law against it signifies nothing in the world.” (Jan.,
1665.)


IS ALARMED.

“About eleven o’clock, knowing what money I have in the house, and
hearing a noise, I began to sweat worse and worse, till I melted almost
to water. I rung, and could not in half an hour make either of the
wenches hear me; and this made me fear the more lest they might be
gagged; and then I began to think that there was some design in a stone
being flung at the window over our stairs this evening, by which the
thieves meant to try what looking there would be after them, and know
our company. These thoughts and fears I had, and do hence apprehend the
fears of all rich men that are covetous, and have much money by them.
At last, Jane rose, and then I understood it was only the dog wants a
lodging, and so made a noise.” (July, 1664.)


UXORIOUS.

“Called upon Doll, our pretty change woman, for a pair of gloves
trimmed with yellow ribbon, to [match] the petticoat my wife bought
yesterday, which cost me 20s.; but she is so pretty, that, God forgive
me! I could not think it too much, which is a strange slavery that I
stand in to beauty, that I value nothing near it.” (Sept., 1664.)

“To the King’s house, to a play, _The Traitor_, where unfortunately, I
met with Sir W. Pen, so that I must be forced to confess it to my wife,
which troubles me.” (Jan., 1665.)

“To Clerkenwell church, and there, as I wished, sat next pew to the
fair Butler, who indeed is a most perfect beauty still; and one I do
very much admire myself for my choice of her for a beauty, having
the best lower part of her face that ever I saw all days of my life.
After church, I walked to my Lady Sandwitch’s. * * My Lady asked me my
opinion about Creed, whether he would have a wife or no, and proposed
Mrs. Wright for him. * * She desired I would take a good time and
manner of proposing it, and I said I would, though I believe he would
love nothing but money. * * So away back to Clerkenwell church, * * and
home, and there my wife was angry with me for not coming home, and for
gadding abroad to look after beauties.” (Oct. 2nd, 1664.)

READING MAKETH A FULL MAN.


BY W. P. A.

Mirrored in the epigram at the head of this article, is the _soul_ of
the great man to whose force of intellect the world is indebted for the
“Inductive Method” of investigation, which has made man a prince over
the mysteries of science and a minister of nature’s sweet and bountiful
gifts.

Never did Bacon philosophize more wisely, or frame epigram more
in accordance with comprehensive truth than when he uttered this
sentiment: “_Reading_ maketh a _full man_.”

Let us stress for a few moments the abstract idea of reading, and the
consequent concrete idea of a full man. The vexatious problem which
immediately confronts us with mountainous proportions, is how can we
make the vast number of scientific languages and dialects, in which
are couched so many thousand volumes of literature, wholesome, pure
and classic, compatible with the brief period allotted to human life,
and the miniature portion of even this time that can be spared from
the bread-and-butter warfare to the reading of other men’s thoughts?
We do not propose a solution of this problem, nor do we believe it
possible for any man to indulge in one grand review of the world’s
literature; but it is the blessed privilege of _every_ man to become
moderately well read, in proof of which we would have only to cite
illustrious names already familiar. “In books lies the soul of the
past,” and if we would quaff the sweet ambrosia which is the world’s
inestimable heritage, and develop in ourselves minds which shall prove
everlasting sources of profit and pleasure, we must wed ourselves, with
unmistakable devotion, to the acquisition of useful knowledge; if we do
not inherit opportunities, we must _make_ them, and read selectively,
comprehensively and retentively.

One individual can’t select for another the books best adapted to the
mental growth of that person; individuality of taste is an idiosyncrasy
of the human race. Give a person free access to a well-regulated
library, and you need not fear but that person will suit himself.
Let the flocks graze at will upon the verdant plains where grow the
herbs both bitter and sweet, and where flow the waters of both life
and death, and an unerring instinct will always avoid the bad and
feast upon the good; then is the _reason_ of man less to be relied
upon than the _instinct_ of the dumb brute? But far be it from us to
argue that any man should cloister himself within the walls of his own
imagination, feasting upon his own secluded judgment, and thus refuse
to lend an ear to a _wise_ suggestion.

A lack of space forbids a more thorough discussion of this tempting
subject—reading; so let us pass to a brief contemplation of the
sequel—a _full man_. If a young man is devoid of a _noble ambition_,
he would do well to examine himself and bring about a correction as
soon as possible. Honest labor is praiseworthy in whatever field it
may be expended, but there is something nobler, more inspiring, more
appreciated, and more remunerative than hewing wood or drawing water;
and if a man can, by thorough preparation, ally himself with the
_intellectual_ aristocracy of the country, then are the possibilities
of a _true_ life spread before him.

What a sublime and God-like spectacle is a _full man_. These are the
men that wear the crowns of earth; in their hands are the sceptres of
state; and in their lives are the world’s treasures.

The Alps may be hard to scale, but the Italy that lies beyond is worthy
of the most giant effort; and those who put on the whole armor for
the contest and stand as _full_ and _well-rounded_ men will be the
Hannibals of unrecorded history.




THE INFINITIVE.


Much hinges on the question, “Is the Infinitive a Mood?” It is
necessary first to define mood. Harvey says that ‘mood’ is the mode
or manner in which the action, being or state is expressed. He says
further, “The infinitive mood expresses action, being, or state without
affirming it.” Though he defines the manner in which the indicative,
the subjunctive, the imperative mood expresses action, being, or state,
he fails to state in what manner the infinitive expresses the same. If
he means to say that it _expresses_ action, being, or state without
affirming it, while the indicative, subjunctive and imperative moods
_affirm_ any of these, and that in this difference lies its claim to be
called a mood, why does he not call participles and gerunds moods, as
they also express action, being or state without affirming it? Mason
says: “Moods are certain variations of form in verbs by means of which
we can show the mode or manner in which the action or fact denoted by
the verb is connected in our thought with the thing that is spoken
of;” furthermore, that the infinitive may be attached to a subject in
a dependent phrase, as ‘I saw him _fall_,’ and that this would justify
us in calling it ‘mood.’ According to Mason, in the sentence, ‘I saw
him _falling_,’ it would be justifiable to call a participle, which
is sometimes called the ‘infinitive in-_ing_,’ a mood. Why then does
Mr. Mason not call it a mood? Besides, in a great majority of cases
the infinitive is used, as in the sentence, ‘I will _go_,’ without
this subject accusative, as Mason calls it. His definition of the word
‘mood,’ though phrased with a view to include the infinitive, does not
give any more light on the question than the definition of Harvey.
Clark holds: “The infinitive mode differs from the other modes in this:
It has no grammatical subject and therefore can not be a predicate.”
Brown, in his “Grammar of English Grammars,” says that the infinitive
mood is that form of the verb which expresses action, being or state
in an unlimited manner. It seems that these authors ought certainly
to have given a clearer or at least a more consistent distinction
between the infinitive, participle and gerund on the one hand, and the
indicative, subjunctive and imperative moods on the other. They make
the infinitive a mood along with these three moods because its manner
of expression is unlimited, while these mood forms are limited, and yet
neglect the participle and gerund, which have, by their definitions,
just as much right to the distinction.

The preposition ‘to’ is not an essential part of the infinitive,
for it is not an invariable sign of it. Many verbs, especially
the auxiliaries, are followed by the infinitive without ‘to.’ The
infinitive in Old English ended in-an and did not have ‘to’ before it.
It was treated as a declinable abstract-noun, and a dative form (called
the gerund) was used with the preposition ‘to’ to denote purpose, as
‘He that hath ears _to hear_’; to hear = _to gehyranne_. This gerundive
infinitive passed into modern English with the loss of the dative
ending. From denoting purpose, the ‘to’ came to denote the ground of
an action, and may indicate the cause or condition of an action. Thus
the gerund (the infinitive with ‘to’) came to be used in place of the
simple infinitive. The preposition ‘to’ has in this manner come to be
nothing but an inflection for the nominative and accusative cases, and
to lose the notional idea of a preposition except with the infinitive
of purpose.

The infinitive is a verb-noun. The authority for this begins with the
fact that it was in Old English declined as an abstract-noun. Prof.
Whitney, of Yale, says that the infinitive is a verbal-noun expressing
in noun-form the action or condition which the verb asserts. Welsh
also calls it a verbal-noun. Both of them say that mood serves the
purpose of showing a difference in the mode or manner of assertion.
These two authors do not consider that the difference in the manner
in which an infinitive and the indicative, subjunctive and imperative
express action is of the same nature as the difference between the
indicative and subjunctive, or between the subjunctive and imperative.
These differences, as any one can plainly see, are altogether unlike.
The distinction between the infinitive and the three moods is by far
greater than any distinctions that the moods have among themselves. The
infinitive, gerund and participle have their verb natures alike. All
three are unlimited to person, number, or order of time. It is only in
the other half of the compound that they differ. The gerund partakes
of the nature of a verb and a noun, while the participle partakes of
the nature of a verb and an adjective, and the infinitive is verbal
in the dependence of other words upon it and has the nature of a noun
in its dependence upon other words. From this it is seen that, if the
term ‘mood’ can be applied to the infinitive, as it pertains only to
its verbal nature, it can be applied to participles and gerunds. If
all three are called moods, then there is a nomenclature which is
not needed and still not such as will separate the two great classes
of verb-forms (finite and infinite) and show the difference in their
expression of action, being or state. The name ‘infinitive,’ it is
true, would denote its manner of expression, but the participle and
the gerund have nothing in their names to denote this same quality.
What is needed is a distinction between the two great classes. If the
infinitive is not called a mood, there is this distinction; if it is
called a mood, then there is need of some other names by which to
distinguish the two classes.

The infinitive has the principal uses of a noun. It may be used as the
subject or object of a verb; it can be used as a noun in the accusation
to modify a noun, ‘A house _to let_;’ it may be used in the accusative
as an adverb, ‘That is hard _to do_.’

All these reasons go to show that the infinitive is a verbal-noun, and
that no one will ever have to contradict himself if he calls it by this
name and does not call it a mood.

The amount of Greek and Latin required in our colleges is necessary
and expedient. The extension of the curricula to include more French
and German is indeed commendable; but the study of the English
language in most of our colleges has been, to say the least of it,
too circumscribed. The earnest English student is not satisfied with
giving the Greek and Latin literatures only a passing notice, but
studies them as languages, both for the mental training they afford,
and for the influence which they have had on the development of his own
language. So the study of English should be the study of a language,
rather than the study of a literature. The old-time curriculum looked
upon the study of English as a “belles lettres” course—merely the study
of literature. This, indeed, is good enough as far as it goes, but it
is neither commensurate with the claims upon the consideration of an
Englishspeaking person, nor with the benefit that is to be derived from
the study of the language, pursued historically. A knowledge of English
in its less developed condition, accompanied by a fair understanding
of the modifying influences and developing changes which have from
time to time been brought to bear upon it, is indeed necessary. It
is as impossible for a person _thoroughly_ to comprehend the English
language without a knowledge of Old English as it is to understand
the Latin language without a fair knowledge of its word-agreement.
The study of either the “belles lettres” or the historical course,
however, to the exclusion of the other is not at all commendable. What
we need and _should_ have in our colleges is a simultaneous study
of these courses accompanied by a thorough study of the grammar of
Modern English so measured out and distributed as mutually to aid in a
thorough comprehension of each other and, consequently, of the language.

       *       *       *       *       *

Among the latest features of the present system of teaching English in
our colleges, may be mentioned the introduction of what is generally
known as “parallel reading.” Formally the student was required during
the great part of his college course, at least, to study only text
books, which tend to train rather than fill the mind. No question
should be of greater importance to a developing mind than what should
I read? This is a question which the student cannot decide without
help. If the mind were originally able to grapple with great subjects,
this would not be a perplexing question, but like other things, the
mind has its infancy, at which period the directing hand of one more
experienced, is quite indispensable. The professor of English and a
good library unite in college, as no where else, to do this important
work of mind-training and mind-filling. This parallel, which is read at
such spare moment as would probably otherwise be lost, not only enables
the student to learn what he _should_ read, but also gives him a fair
knowledge of the leading English authors. For example, if, in this way,
one book is read per month, the student, at the end of his four years
college course will have read about forty books, which having been
carefully selected by his professor will give him _some_ knowledge of
English literature.

Phrenology may have some truth in it as a science, but implicit
confidence, to say the least, should not be placed in the statements of
so-called phrenologists. A phrenologist has recently visited Trinity
and examined the heads of a good many of the students, and as a rule
to their _supreme satisfaction_. The strange part about it is that
all the students, with a few exceptions, had _special_ talents for
the professions—would make first-class lawyers, doctors, preachers,
&c.; but lo and behold! scarcely a single one was told that he would
make a good farmer. Such taffying pays the phrenologist very well
financially, but may do harm to the young man who is thus flattered,
as he will often conceive that he is indeed a genius, and imagine that
he will become a distinguished professional man if he only turns his
_marvellous_ talents in that direction, when he is not suited for such
in the least. There _may be_ something in phrenology, but the young
man who relies upon the fine marks given him by a phrenologist as
conclusive proof of the fact that he will make a grand success, will
eventually find himself left in the race of life. Energy is the great
thing after all. The boy who has energy will be certain of some success
at least. So it does not matter so much whether you have a fifty-four
or forty-nine ounce brain, but whether you improve what you have. You

    PSYCHOLOGY. By John Dewey, Ph. D.,
        Assistant Professor of Philosophy in Michigan University.
        New York: Harper & Brothers, 1887. pp. xii, 427.

This book is designed purely for class-room instruction. The author has
endeavored to produce a work free from metaphysics, which he tells us
has no place in psychology. With this in mind, he has also endeavored
to make his work an introduction to philosophy in general. He has
attempted, by his mode of presenting his subjects, to form in the mind
of the student the habit of looking at questions, which may present
themselves to him, in a philosophical manner. The _obscurity_ which
characterizes most books on this subject, and which always leaves the
mind of the beginner in a state of bewilderment, is to a great extent
gotten rid of. The definitions are plain and simple; the disquisitions
are full but not tedious. At the end of each chapter, numerous
references are given to parallel works on the subjects treated. A
writer on psychology may reject some of the matter which that subject
includes, as for instance, the _will_, but he cannot make new material;
he can only present in an _attractive manner_ that which men have used
for centuries. The author has done this admirably.

    A TRAMP TRIP. How to see Europe for fifty cents a day.
        By Lee Meriweather. Harper & Bros.
        For sale by De Wolfe, Fiske & Co., Boston, Mass.
        pp. iv. 276. 1886.

There are many young men who desire to broaden their field of knowledge
and more strongly impress upon their minds historic scenes by traveling
in Europe, and yet these young men are prevented by not having the
amount of money generally requisite for traveling. To such “A Tramp
Trip” will be especially interesting. The author tells how he has made
a trip in which he saw all the objects of interest, was enabled to
study the masses from a standpoint totally inaccessible to the wealthy
traveler, and all for the exceedingly low sum of fifty cents a day. A
number of tables show the result of his investigation of the social
conditions, and therein are some instructive illustrations of the
tariff question as applied to foreign countries. The style is the free
and easy and there is enough wit to make the work very interesting.

    SLIPS OF TONGUE AND PEN.
        By J. H. Long, M. A., LL. D.
        New York: D. Appleton & Co. pp. 100. 1888.

Here we have an unusually well selected list of the more common
mistakes of our language, such as _expect_ for _think_, _presume_
for _believe_, _per_ with an English word, as _per day_; we should
say _a day_ and _per annum_. Beside such as these are also added
grammatical points, suggestions upon composition, synonymous words
often confused, objectionable words and phrases, and a few simple rules
for punctuation. Many of us would be surprised if we should read it and
learn how much carelessness and inexactness injure the purity of our
language.

    POETICAL GEOGRAPHY OF NORTH CAROLINA,
            Cold Water, Reply to Gray’s Elegy, and other Poems.
        By Needham Bryan Cobb, of North Carolina. Cambridge:
        Printed at the Riverside Press. pp. 61, 1887.

As the author states in his preface, the object of this work is to aid
the pupils of North Carolina to memorize the geography of their native
State. The first thirty pages are devoted exclusively to this purpose,
and hence can be of local interest only. The chief characteristic
of the style of this part of the book is that it rimes in couplets.
The subject-matter falls far below the true standard of poetry, but
this is perfectly excusable when it is remembered that the author’s
intention was not to weave in beautiful poetic figures with smoothly
flowing rhythm, but to produce a brief, concise aid to the memory. The
remainder of the book, which consists of poems on various subjects,
contains more of the real poetic sentiment. The “Reply to Gray’s
Elegy,” “Cold Water,” and “Worldliness and Worth, or the Butterfly and
the Bee,” which closes with fine moral on Bible-reading, are especially
to be admired. This little book should be in the library of every
student in our State. It contains a number of good illustrations, and
its general _make-up_ is attractive.

    LIFE OF P. T. BARNUM. Written by himself,
            including his golden rules for moneymaking.
        Brought up to 1888. Illustrated.
        Buffalo: The Courier Company. pp. 357, 12m. 1888.
        Price 60 cents.

It is always interesting to watch the struggles of men who would
grow wealthy. Then there will be found much interest in the account
of the struggles of “The Greatest Showman on Earth.” His life reads
like a novel, so full is it of incident. He makes the keynote of his
success the fact that Americans admire nothing more than to be cleverly
humbugged, and he knows how to satisfy them. His avowed object, a good
one, is to furnish a moral show. When this can be attained, shows will
become an educational feature by no means to be despised.

“The greatness of London is in no respect more strikingly illustrated
than by the range of its literary activity,” says the May number of
_Harper’s Magazine_ at the close of that interesting article entitled
“London as a Literary Centre.” Few people are aware of the fact that
to-day 14,000 persons in the great metropolis earn their living by
their pens. London is the centre of action of many whose names have
become household words wherever the English language is spoken. Read
the article.

Diversity seems to have been ordained of God. This is especially
evident in the animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms, and the same
law, with some modifications, underlies the world of thought. No two
men think alike, act alike or pronounce exactly alike. The difference
between the lexicographers of England and America is very apparent,
although the two countries are very closely connected by means of rapid
communication. Even American orthoëpists differ. Usage has established
in New England, for instance, a pronounciation somewhat different
from that in the South. Dictionaries do not _establish_ usage, but
_record_ usage, and no dictionary is complete if it records the
usage of simply a few States. How great a diversity there is between
Webster, Worcester, and Stormonth, commonly recognized authorities!
The person to whom ‘accessory’ (ak-seśso-ri, Webster) is applied,
Worcester calls ak´ses-so-ri. Both Webster and Worcester prefer to
accent the first syllable of ‘access,’ while “The Academy Orthoëpist”
accents the second. In pronouncing ‘Christianity’ the usage of the
South is in accordance with Worcester (kris-ti-ańi-ti), and not
Webster (krist-yań-i-ti). The words ‘rise’ (noun) and ‘revolution’
for instance, are pronounced by the South riz and rev-o-loó-tion by
Webster and Worcester ris and rev-o-lútion. The Archive was pleased to
see the stand which the _Roanoke Collegian_ had taken on the subject
of orthoepy. In many instances in pronunciation, when in Rome, it is
better to do as Rome does.

Some one has been collecting facts about the fathers of United States
Presidents, with this result: Grover Cleveland is the only Clergyman’s
son who has ever been elected President, though Arthur’s father was a
clergyman. He was not, however, elected President. The fathers of the
Virginia Presidents—Washington, Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe—were
planters. John Tyler’s father was a lawyer and a statesman, and John
Adams, the father of John Q. Adams, was by profession a lawyer.
Grant was a tanner. Hayes’s father a merchant, and the fathers of
Garfield, Lincoln, Pierce, Fillmore, Polk, Van Buren and Jackson were
farmers.—_Charlotte Chronicle._

Napoleon, while at St. Helena, when asked how the condition of unhappy
France could be bettered, replied in his laconic style “Educate the
mothers.” The same remark will apply to every country, and it is with
special interest that THE ARCHIVE notices _The Monitor_, a monthly
brim full of plain, pointed common-sense articles. This new magazine
hails from Henderson, and is devoted to the interests of “Our Homes.”
One of its aims is to make better cooks and better mothers. To know how
to cook is more necessary to a truly educated woman than a knowledge
of painting and wax-work. A man that marries a wife who has no idea of
culinary affairs will either be poor all his life or die early with the
dyspepsia.

Intelligence among the masses is very essential to the success of a
newspaper as well as to a great many other benefits. A weekly paper
will succeed in many places where a daily would fail, especially is
this so when a majority of the people are engaged in rural pursuits.
The success and high tone of such dailies as the _Charlotte Chronicle_,
_Wilmington Messenger_, _News and Observer_, and the _Twin City Daily_
argue well both for the ability of their editors and the intelligent
spirit of the people. What State that has no more city population than
North Carolina can show a larger list of newsy and literary dailies?

       *       *       *       *       *

The third anniversary issue of the _Daily Argus_ is full of interesting
news and wood cuts of Goldsboro’s churches, fine buildings, &c. It is
another of the successful dailies.

The subject of Kissing is treated at great length in an article in
the _South Carolina Collegian_. This unique subject is a good one
and one which should receive more attention. The author says: “I feel
that my subject will commend itself to the majority of college-boy
readers.” His feelings did not deceive him in the least; but why not
say college-girl readers as well? The girls must feel slighted. Does
he mean to say that boys are the only ones who enjoy kissing? It is to
be supposed that the fair sex derive some benefit from it or it would
soon fall into a state of “innocuous desuetude.” At present, from all
indications, it seems to be in a flourishing condition, and who could
desire it to be otherwise?

The _Binghamite_ for March presents a marked improvement upon any
number previously received. It is clothed throughout in a new dress and
is now as neat a magazine as could be desired. With the improvement of
its outward appearance, the reading matter has also undergone a change
for the better. The majority of the articles are very good. The one
entitled “India: Her Past and Present,” being especially worthy of note.

_The Christian Educator_ for April has been received. It is full of
very interesting articles. “The Bible in the Schools,” by J. W. Baylis,
D. D., and “Something for Everybody to do for Trinity,” by Pres. J. F.
Crowell, are articles of worth. The _Educator_ is published, it seems,
in the interest of all the colleges in the State.

—C. W. Robinson, ’86, is one of the growing young ministers of the
North Carolina Conference. He is pastor of the West End church,
Winston, N. C., and is quite popular. Bro. Robinson is yet unmarried,
but if the reports concerning the frequency of his “pastoral calls,”
which are so essential to the success of every minister, be true, we
may reasonably expect in the near future a change—for the better.

—M. A. Gray, ’75, graduated with high honor, and choosing the law
as his profession, he entered the law school of Judge Pearson, at
“Richmond Hill,” and was licensed to practice in the courts of this
State. He represented Lenoir county in the last Legislature and is a
member of committees on the Judiciary and salaries and fees. It is a
fact worthy of note that every member of the class to which Mr. G.
belonged, while at Judge Pearson’s, has since represented his own
county in the Legislature.

—John C. Everett is book-keeper for one of the leading merchants in
Bennettsville, S. C. In June, ’87, he went from Trinity to Lexington
Business College, Lexington, Kentucky, where he obtained a first-class

N. C. He represented his district in the last session of the Senate,
and is chairman of the committee on Enrolled Bills. The legislative
biographical sketch book of the session of 1887 pays him the following
high compliment: “Mr. T. is a leader on his side of the Senate, and
mentally, physically and socially has few equals and no superiors in
our present Assembly of law-makers. With striking personal appearance,
excellent mental attainments, pleasant and engaging social qualities,
he commands that recognition to which these and other qualifications so
justly entitle him.”

—B. G. Marsh, 84, is principal of a successful school at Troy, N. C.
In a letter recently received from Mr. Marsh he has this to say: “The
ARCHIVE is well edited. It is a neat paper and reflects credit upon
its editors and the Institution. I am truly in sympathy with you all,
and hope and pray that our beloved Alma Mater will soon be the college
for all Methodists of North Carolina. I shall send all the boys I
can to Trinity, because I know they will be well cared for and well
instructed, not only in literary attainments, but also in all things
pertaining to a full Christian gentleman.”

—F. M. Shamburger, ’83, is in charge of Plymouth Station in Washington
District, N. C. Conference. This is his second year at this place. He
has proved a faithful pastor and has accomplished lasting good. His
love for Trinity, like that of all her true and worthy sons, has not
abated, and he continues to work for the promotion of her interests.

near Trinity, and has quite an extensive practice in the counties of
Randolph and Davidson.

      MR. EDITOR:—I am heartily in sympathy
    with the object so worthy the earnest efforts
    which the students are putting forth for its
    accomplishment—the Society and Library Building. Old
    students, one and all, let us not turn a deaf ear to
    their timely and earnest appeals, but let us prove
    our loyalty and devotion to our Institution, and
    manifest our interest in the proper education of the
    young men who shall attend it by lending our aid in
    the erection of the proposed building. You may put me
    down for $50.00.

                                     B. B. ADAMS.

the pleasure of describing the Asheville trip in this issue, as the

An Athletic Association has been formed for the development of the
