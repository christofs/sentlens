QUOTES AND IMAGES:  MARGUERITE DE VALOIS



THE MEMOIRS OF MARGUERITE DE VALOIS


By Maguerite de Valois, Queen of Navarre





Adversity is solitary, while prosperity
dwells in a crowd

Comeliness of his person, which at all
times pleads powerfully

Envy and malice are self-deceivers

Everything in the world bore a double
aspect

From faith to action the bridge is
short

Hearsay liable to be influenced by
ignorance or malice

Honours and success are followed by
envy

Hopes they (enemies) should hereafter
become our friends

I should praise you more had you
praised me less

It is the usual frailty of our sex to
be fond of flattery

Lovers are not criminal in the
estimation of one another

Mistrust is the sure forerunner of
hatred

Much is forgiven to a king

Necessity is said to be the mother of
invention

Never approached any other man near
enough to know a difference

Not to repose too much confidence in
our friends

Parliament aided the King to expel the
Jesuits from France

Prefer truth to embellishment

Rather out of contempt, and because it
was good policy

Situated as I was betwixt fear and hope

The pretended reformed religion

The Massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day

The record of the war is as the smoke
of a furnace

There is too much of it for earnest,
and not enough for jest

Those who have given offence to hate
the offended party

To embellish my story I have neither
leisure nor ability

Troubles might not be lasting

Young girls seldom take much notice of
children
