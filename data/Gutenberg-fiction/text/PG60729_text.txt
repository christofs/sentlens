Shropshire


THIS is an inland shire, bounded on the north by Cheshire and a detached
portion of the Welch county of Flint; on the east by Staffordshire; on
the south by the counties of Radnor, Hereford, and Worcester; and on the
west by those of Denbigh and Montgomery.  In length, from north to south,
it is about forty-five miles, and its extreme breadth about thirty-five:
its circumference is computed at one hundred and sixty miles, comprising
an area of 1,341 square miles, or about 826,055 statute acres.  In size
it ranks as the sixteenth English county, and in population as the
twenty-sixth.

NAME and EARLY HISTORY.—The derivation of the name Salop, or Shropshire,
has not been with any degree of certainty established; indeed, so vague
and various are the opinion of writers upon this subject, that to attempt
to dispel the obscurity of its etymology would be to assume a task more
critical than useful.  This part of the Island was originally inhabited
by the Celtic tribe _Cornavii_, and their chief city (which was situated,
not far from the site of the present town of Shrewsbury), after its
conquest by the Romans, became a station of the latter people, called
_Vriconium_, and was fortified by them to secure the passage of the
Severn.  Under the Roman dominion Shropshire was included in the division
called _Flavia Cæsariensis_.  Shrewsbury is the principal, as it is the
county town of Salop; yet, although no doubt can be entertained of its
high antiquity, there is no authentic record of its origin: conjecture
has, however, assigned that event to the fifth century.  About this time
Shrewsbury was esteemed the most important position on the Marches of
Wales, and a strong fortress at this point continued for several
centuries to be one of the principal places of rendezvous for the English
armies, and hence was often visited by successive monarchs of the Saxon
and Norman dynasties.  In the military and political events connected
with the county, Shrewsbury appears to have been a large participator.
In the reigns of John and Henry III. it was taken by storm, being
defended, on the latter occasion, by the adherents of the Empress Maude;
and in the same Henry’s reign it was partly burnt by the Welch.  In the
reign of Edward I. a parliament was holden here, and David, the last of
the Welch princes, beheaded.  In this neighbourhood was fought a bloody
battle between the army of Henry IV., commanded by his renowned son, and
the forces of the fiery Henry Percy (surnamed ‘Hotspur’), in which the
latter was slain, and after his interment his body was taken from the
grave, and beheaded, as was his uncle, the Earl of Worcester.  Richard,
Duke of York, and George Plantagenet, sons of Edward IV., were born in
Shrewsbury.  Oswestry (corrupted from _Oswaldstree_) was conspicuous as a
border town, and frequently became the scene of contest, first, between
the Saxons and Britons, and afterwards between the latter and the
Normans: the remains of its ancient castle, even in their present ruined
state, are sufficient to attest its original prodigious strength.  In the
great civil war of the seventeenth century, Shropshire was the scene of
much violence and bloodshed.  In 1651, when Charles II. was fleeing,
after the disastrous issue of the battle of Worcester, he, on the 4th of
October, took refuge in White Ladies’ Priory, on the eastern side of the
county; from that place he was conducted to Boscobel House, and, the day
after his arrival there, was concealed, in company with Colonel Careless,
in the ‘Royal Oak,’ in an adjoining wood, from whence he removed to a
more secure hiding-place in Staffordshire.  The last hostile movement
made in the county was an ineffectual attempt, in 1654, by Sir Thomas
Harris and others, to surprise the castle of Shrewsbury for the king.

SOIL, CLIMATE, and AGRICULTURAL, &c.  PRODUCE.—Few counties possess a
greater variety of SOIL, or are more diversified in appearance: divided
into nearly two equal parts by the Severn, its south and west portions
assume the mountainous character exhibited by the counties of Montgomery
and Denbigh; whilst the northern half approaches the resemblance of a
level, agreeably relieved by a few single hills and romantic valleys,
finely wooded.  The meadows on the side of the Severn are remarkably
fertile, being occasionally enriched by the overflowing of that river,
which is navigable throughout its whole course.  The famed _Wrekin_
mountain, celebrated for the magnificent and extensive prospects which it
commands, rears itself singly out of the plain to the height of nearly
1,200 feet above the level of the Severn, near which it rises.  To the
east of the Wrekin, and on the eastern border of the county, lies the
coal district of Coalbrookdale, which extends, from north-east to
south-west, about eight miles in length and two in breadth.  The CLIMATE
is considered highly salubrious; the air is pure, although in many
situations sharp and piercing.  The PRODUCTIONS of the county are various
and valuable; the breed of cows and sheep deserve particular notice—the
former yielding abundant quantities of milk, while the sheep, fed upon
its hilly tracts, afford some of the finest fleeces obtained in the
kingdom.  The whole county is in general well cultivated, furnishing
liberal supplies of grain; its southern border produces excellent hops,
agreeably varied with fine healthy orchards.  The crops most common in
Shropshire are wheat, barley, oats, peas, and turnips.  Rye was formerly
cultivated extensively, but it has been superseded by wheat.  In the
eastern part of the county turnips are almost universally grown, as also
on the rocky lands of the western side of it.  Potatoes are generally
cultivated—hemp and flax rarely, and beans but in inconsiderable
quantities.  The principal artificial grasses are the broad-leafed
clover, Dutch clover, trefoil, and ray grass.  Shropshire is not
particularly famous for its dairies: in that part of it lying to the
north-east of the Severn they are small, and, as much butter is made, the
cheese is not of the first quality.  On the north-western side of the
same district the dairies are much larger, and more cheese is made—some
of a very superior quality, rivalling the ‘Cheshire.’  Clun Forest, an
extensive sheep walk contains about 12,000 acres.  There are some large
rabbit warrens upon the Longmynd and Brown Clee hill.  In the
neighbourhood of Clun great numbers of turkeys are reared, as are geese
on the commons.  This county has at various times been denuded of its
timber, great supplies having been furnished for the purpose of
ship-building at Bristol; but there are still numerous fine woods of oak,
and extensive coppices of the same kind of timber: much of the latter,
after eighteen years’ growth, is cut and made into charcoal for the
various iron works.

MINERALS and MANUFACTURES.—Rich as this county is in the productions of
the field, the treasures extracted from its bowels are not of less
importance.  Lead, iron, limestone, pipe-clay, and coal are found in
great abundance; and in the hundred of North Bradford are salt springs;
whilst, on the eastern side of the county, are extensive iron-works, that
give employment to hundreds of hands.  The chief MANUFACTURE is
porcelain, which is of great excellence and in proportionate demand.  In
the neighbourhood of Shrewsbury are extensive iron foundries, and it was
here the noble Menai bridge was cast.  In the parish of Madeley are iron
works of great magnitude; the stupendous iron bridge that bestrides the
Severn at this place was constructed here: there are also two at
Oswestry.  At Coalport are china manufactories of great celebrity, and
the manufacture of chain is carried on here, and also at Cradley; at
Bridgnorth carpets and porcelain are manufactured; at Broseley various
descriptions of pottery ware, including tobacco-pipes, held in great
estimation; at Hales Owen (which is now incorporated with Worcestershire)
nails and pearl buttons are made, and there are also some extensive iron
works; and Ludlow and its vicinity derive considerable prosperity from an
extensive malting trade.

RIVERS, LAKES and MINERAL SPRINGS, CANALS and RAILWAYS.—The principal
RIVERS of this county are the Severn, the Tern, and the Rodan; the
smaller ones are the Teme, the Colun, the Warren and the Rea, besides
numerous inconsiderable streams and brooks, the waters of almost all of
which finally reach the Severn.  The noble Severn enters Shropshire at
Melverley, about eleven miles from Shrewsbury—flows pass the latter town,
and, after visiting Coalbrookdale, Madeley and Bridgnorth, enters
Worcestershire at Bewdley.  The Tern rises in Staffordshire, and enters
the north part of the county, where, after receiving the waters of the
Rodan, it runs into the Severn near Brompton Ferry.  The Rodan has its
source in the north of the county, and joins the Tern near Walcott.  The
LAKES, though neither numerous or of great extent, form a variety in the
landscape not often met with in the midland counties; that adjoining
Ellesmere covers nearly one hundred and twenty acres, and there are
several others in the neighbourhood, but of smaller dimensions.  Near
Whitchurch are two other lakes or meres; while, on the northern side of
the Severn, are those of Fennymere, Llynclys-pool, and Ancot.  On the
western side of the county is Marton-pool, covering about forty acres;
and at Shrawardine is a fine piece of water of nearly the same extent:
there is another Marton pool on the northern side of the Severn, of
nearly the same size as the former.  South of the Severn, and a few miles
from Shrewsbury, is Beaumere, a small but lovely sheet of water; and
almost adjoining it is Shomere.  There are MEDICINAL SPRINGS of different
qualities at Smeithmore and Moreton-Say, in the hundred of Bradford, and
at Admaston, two miles and a half north-west from Wellington, in the
parish of Wrockwardine.  At the latter, and near to the Wrekin hill, is a
capital Inn and Baths, called the ‘Admaston Spa Hotel and Boarding
House.’  There are other springs near Ludlow, at Broseley, and in the
vicinity of Wenlock.  About two miles to the south of Shrewsbury, and
close to Sutton village, is a spring, the waters of which are saline and
chalybeate, and somewhat resemble those of Cheltenham.  The CANALS which
pass through Shropshire are the Ellesmere, the Shrewsbury, the Kington,
the Donington Wood, and the Dudley Extension; all in a greater or less
degree important, and perhaps essential to the carrying trade of the
county.  RAILWAYS, for the conveyance of heavy articles, have for years,
and to a considerable extent, been in use in this county.  The extensive
iron and coal tract about Coalbrookdale is intersected by numerous
tram-roads, leading from the coal works to the different foundries, and
the wharfs on the banks of the canal and the river Severn.  The
Shrewsbury and Chester Railway proceeds from the latter city, by way of
Wrexham, Rhuabon, Clun, and Oswestry, to Shrewsbury, where it meets the
Shrewsbury and Hereford railway: this line visits Ludlow, and soon after
leaves the county for that of Hereford.  The communication by rail
between the Metropolis and Liverpool includes Salop in the advantages
consequent thereupon, by the opening of the Shrewsbury and Birmingham
line, and the Shrewsbury and Chester; while a direct intercourse is
maintained with Staffordshire and the Pottery district by means of the
Shrewsbury and Stafford branch of the Shropshire Union railway.  There
are also two other lines projected, or in progress; one to be called the
Crewe and Shrewsbury Extension, the other the Severn Valley Line; the
latter will pass through the extensive coal and iron district before
mentioned.

ECCLESIASTICAL and CIVIL DIVISIONS, and REPRESENTATION.—Shropshire is in
the province of Canterbury, and includes parts of the several diocesses
of Hereford, Lichfield and Coventry, and St. Asaph.  It is included in
the Oxford circuit, and divided into fourteen hundreds or districts,
comprising two hundred and fourteen parishes, and eleven parts of
parishes, containing one county town (Shrewsbury), and sixteen other
market towns.  The whole county, before the Reform Bill passed, returned
twelve members to parliament, namely, two each for Bishop’s Castle,
Bridgnorth, Ludlow, Shrewsbury and Wenlock, and two for the shire.  The
new act deprived Bishop’s Castle of its ancient privilege, and gave two
additional members to the county at large; the number of representatives
is, therefore, the same as heretofore.  The shire is divided into two
representative districts, named the Northern Division and the Southern
Division.  The former comprises the hundreds of Oswestry, Pimhill, North
and South Bradford, and the liberty of Shrewsbury; and the Southern
Division includes the hundreds of Brimstrey, Cherbury, Condover, Ford,
Manslow, Overs, Purslow (including Clun and Stoddesdon), and the
franchise of Wenlock.  The return of members for the Northern Division of
the county is made from Shrewsbury, and for the Southern from Church
Stretton.  Besides the place of return, the Northern Division polls at
Oswestry, Whitchurch, and Wellington; and the Southern Division at
Bridgnorth, Ludlow, Bishop’s Castle, Clun, Shiffnall, and Wenlock.  The
members returned at the general election in 1852, for the Northern
Division, were William Ormsby Gore, Esquire, of Porkington Hall,
Oswestry, and John Whitehall Dodd, Esquire, of Cloverley Hall,
Whitchurch, both in this county; and for the Southern Division, the
Honourable Robert Henry Clive, 53, Grosvenor-street, London, and Viscount
Newport, Wilton-crescent, London (all four re-elected).

POPULATION, &c.—By the returns made to Government at the census of 1851,
Shropshire contained 114,340 males and 115,001 females—total 229,341;
exhibiting an increase, over the returns of 1841, of 3,521 persons.  The
annual value of Real Property in this county, as assessed to the Poor
Rates in 1850, amounted to £1,195,032.

BISHOP’S CASTLE AND NEIGHBOURHOOD.


BISHOP’S CASTLE is a borough corporate, market town, and parish, having
separate jurisdiction, locally in the hundred of Purslow, 157 miles N.W.
by W. from London, 20 S.W. by S. from Shrewsbury, and 8½ S.E. from
Montgomery (North Wales).  It is situated partly on the summit, but
chiefly on the steep declivity of a hill, in the midst of a fertile
country, abounding with pleasing views.  The town, which is irregularly
built, and the habitations, for the most part, detached, derives its name
from a castle, that stood here, belonging to the Bishop of Hereford—but
of which the site (now a bowling green belonging to the Castle Inn), and
some small portions of the walls, only can be traced.  The government of
the town, by charter granted in the 15th year of Elizabeth, and confirmed
and extended by James I. is vested in a bailiff, recorder, and fifteen
capital burgesses, assisted by a town clerk, a serjeant-at-mace and
subordinate officers: the bailiff, late bailiff and recorder are justices
of the peace.  The corporation hold a court of session quarterly; and
Bishop’s Castle is included in the twenty-seventh circuit of County
Court-towns, under the acts passed for the recovery of debts not
exceeding £50.  The town hall, a plain brick edifice, erected by
subscription of the burgesses in 1750, has a prison on the basement for
criminals, and above it one for debtors.  The elective franchise was
conferred in the 26th of Elizabeth, from which time it sent two members
to parliament, till the Reform Bill deprived it of that privilege, but
made it a polling station at the election of representatives for South
Shropshire.

About ten miles distant from the town are some considerable lead mines;
but those works have no influence upon the trade or prosperity of the
place—the former being entirely of a local nature, without manufacturing
establishments of any kind.

The parish church of Saint John the Baptist, is a fine old structure,
principally in the Norman style, with a square embattled tower, crowned
with pinnacles; it was burnt by Cromwell in the parliamentary war, and
was re-built without a due regard to the original style of its
architecture.  The living is a vicarage, in the gift of the Earl Powis
and Rev. William Morgan Rowlands is the present vicar.  There are places
of worship for Independents and Primitive Methodists.  The free school
here was founded in 1737 by Mrs. Mary Morris, and endowed with £1,000. in
the three per cents., for the instruction of twenty-five boys and
twenty-five girls in reading, writing and arithmetic, and the girls also
in plain sewing.  There are some handsome seats within a few miles of
Bishop’s Castle—Walcott, the property of the Earl Powis, is about four
miles distant; Linley Hall, the seat of Thomas Frederick More Esq. is
about the same distance, and nearer the town is Oakeley, belonging to the
family of that name.  The market is held on Friday; and the fairs on
March 26th, and 27th, the first Friday after May 13th, the second Monday
in June, July 5th, Friday before July 13th, September 9th, and November
13th.  By the government returns for 1841 the borough and parish
contained 1,781 inhabitants, and by those for 1851, 1,961

BRIDGNORTH,
WITH THE VILLAGE OF QUATFORD AND NEIGHBOURHOOD.


BRIDGNORTH is a market town and borough, both corporate and
parliamentary, having separate jurisdiction, locally in the hundred of
Stoddesdon; 139 miles N.W. from London, 20 S.E. from Shrewsbury, 13
N.N.W. from Kidderminster, the like distance W. by S. from Wolverhampton,
and 27 W. by N. from Birmingham.  It is charmingly and romantically
situated on the banks of the Severn, which river divides it into two
parts, called the Upper Town and the Lower Town.  The Upper Town lies on
the summit and steep declivities of a rock, rising abruptly to the height
of one hundred and eighty feet from the western bank of the river, and
presents an appearance singularly picturesque.  The river is crossed by a
handsome stone bridge of six arches, leading into the Lower Town.  This
place, according to some authorities, was anciently called _Brugia_,
_Brug_, and (including Little Brug) _Bruges_, deriving its name from a
bridge over the Severn, built by the Saxons and destroyed by the Danes.
Upon the erection of a new bridge, about a mile and a half to the north
of the former, it obtained the appellation of _Brug North_, whence its
present name is deduced.  Mr. Smalman’s opinion respecting the derivation
of the name, ‘Bridgnorth,’ is somewhat opposed to this statement; we
therefore refer the reader to that gentleman’s ‘History of Quatford,’ as
well meriting the attention of the etymologist.  This town appears to
have obtained some consequence as early as the time of Ethelfleda, wife
of King Ethelred, and was fortified and furnished with a castle by Robert
de Belesme.  This fortress was of great magnitude, and was of much
importance so late as the civil war, when it sustained great damage in
the struggle for its possession by the royalists and parliamentarians.

The trade of Bridgnorth, to a certain extent, may be said to arise from
the navigation of the river, which affords every facility for the transit
of goods.  At one period it had a good iron trade, which has declined;
and the principal manufactory now existing here is that for carpets,
carried on by two establishments.  The malting business is a branch in
which many persons are employed, and the article produced is of a very
superior quality.  There is at present (1856) in the course of erection,
at the bottom of High-street, a large and elegant Town Hall, which will,
when completed, be a great ornament to the town.  There are two good
commercial Inns, the ‘Castle’ and the ‘Crown,’ both in High-street.
About three miles to the south of Bridgnorth, on the western bank of the
Severn, are the Eardington Iron Works, being one of the most extensive
establishments for the manufacture of charcoal-wire iron in the kingdom.
The inhabitants of this town received a succession of charters from the
reign of Henry I. to that of James II.  Under the latter the borough was
governed until the Municipal Act, passed in 1835, vested the jurisdiction
in a mayor, four aldermen, and twelve councillors, assisted by a recorder
and town-clerk.  The mayor and borough magistrates hold a court of record
in the Town Hall, every alternate Monday, for the trial of petty offences
committed within the borough.  The county magistrates meet at the
justices’ hall every alternate Saturday, to determine cases which occur
without the liberties of the borough; and quarter sessions are held for
the borough, before Uvedale Corbett, Esq. the recorder, who is also the
judge of the County Court, which latter is held monthly in the Town Hall,
for the recovery of debts and damages not exceeding £50.  This town
received the elective franchise in the 23rd year of Edward I, and from
that time has continued to return two members; the mayor is the returning
officer.  The gentlemen returned to sit for the borough, at the general
election in 1852, were Henry Whitmore; Esq. White House, and J.
Pritchard, Esq. Broseley.  The Boundary Act defines the limits of the
borough to comprise ‘the old borough of Bridgnorth, and the several
parishes of Quatford, Oldbury, Tasley, and Astley Abbotts;’ and the same
act appoints Bridgnorth a polling station at the election of members to
represent South Salop.  By charter of King John, the burgesses are exempt
from tolls, or other duties, in all cities, towns, fairs, or markets in
England, except the city of London and its liberties.

There are two parish churches—that of Saint Mary Magdalene and that of
Saint Leonard.  The first named is a modern edifice, in the Grecian style
of architecture, with a lofty tower, surmounted by a cupola, and stands
near the site of the chapel formerly belonging to the castle.  The church
of Saint Leonard, formerly collegiate, was originally a very magnificent
and spacious structure, comprising seven different chapels; it suffered
greatly while in the possession of the parliamentarians during the civil
war, and now consists only of a nave, one aisle, and a chancel.  The
chancel has lately been in part restored, and a beautiful painted window
furnished on the south side—the gift of an individual.  Both the livings,
which were formerly perpetual curacies, are now rectories, the tithes
having been made over to them by the liberality of the late Thomas
Whitmore, Esq. of Afley.  There are places of worship for Independents,
Wesleyan Methodists, Baptists, Irvingites, and Roman Catholics.  The free
grammar school here was founded by the corporation in 1503; it has three
exhibitions to either University.  The other free schools are a blue coat
school, and two conducted upon the national plan.  An infirmary and
general dispensary, a savings’ bank, a subscription library, and a
mechanics’ institution, are the other principal public establishments.
The market is held on Saturday; and the fairs on the third Mondays in
January, February, and March, the 1st of May, the second Monday in June
(for wool, stock and cheese), the second Monday in July, the third
Mondays in August and September, the 29th of October (for stock, hops,
butter, and cheese), and the second Monday in December.  The October fair
is a very large one for cattle, butter, and cheese, the December fair is
for nearly the same commodities, on a smaller scale.  The borough of
Bridgnorth, exclusive of the parishes added to it by the Boundary Act,
contained, by the returns made to Government in 1841, 6,198 inhabitants,
and in 1851, 5,724.

QUATFORD is a parish, consisting of two portions, under the same
parochial management, partly divided by the river Severn; the eastern
division, consisting of the township of Quatford, in the liberties of
Bridgnorth; and the western, of the township of Eardington, in the
hundred of Stoddesdon.  The village is situated close to the Severn,
within a mile and a half from Bridgnorth.  ‘The ancient history of this
place,’ says Mr. Smalman, ‘has been misrepresented by most modern
writers, and strangely applied to Bridgnorth, before the latter could
possibly exist.’  The modern interest of Quatford has arisen from
considerable architectural additions, made with reference to the natural
character of the place, since the larger portion of it became the
property of the late Mr. Smalman, and the site of his former building
establishment.  The parish of Quatford, including the township of
EARDINGTON, contained in 1841, 553 inhabitants, and in 1851, 692.

BROSELEY AND MADELEY,
WITH COALBROOKDALE, COALPORT, IRONBRIDGE, BENTHALL, DAWLEY, AND
NEIGHBOURHOODS.


BROSELEY is a parish in the franchise of Wenlock—the market town is 146
miles N.W. from London, 13 S.E. from Shrewsbury, 4 E. from Wenlock, and 7
from Wellington, at present the nearest railway station.  It is situated
on the Severn, which river separates it from Madeley, Ironbridge, and
Coalbrookdale.  In ancient records it is written _Burwardesley_, probably
deriving that appellation from a family named Burward, to which it
formerly belonged.  Its extent and importance are owing to the numerous
mines of coal and ironstone abounding in the neighbourhood.  It consists
principally of one long street, with smaller ones branching off
irregularly, leading to the different collieries and other works.  The
produce of the former is chiefly appropriated to the supply of iron
foundries, and in the manufacture of fire-bricks, tiles and
tobacco-pipes—the last mentioned being an article for which Broseley has
long been noted.  The town is within the jurisdiction of the borough of
Wenlock.  Courts leet for the manor are held in the town-hall, a handsome
brick building, in April and October, at the latter of which four
constables are appointed; and a court of requests, for the recovery of
debts under 40s. was generally held on alternate Wednesdays, until the
new county court acts came into operation, by which debts can be
recovered to the amount of £50.: this court is held at Madeley, and
Broseley is included within its jurisdiction.  The parish church of All
Saints, erected on the site of Saint Leonard’s, and first opened for
divine service in 1845, is a beautiful chaste structure.  The living is a
rectory, in the patronage of Lord Forester; the present incumbent is the
Hon. and Rev. O. W. W. Forester.  The other places of worship are St.
Mary’s chapel of ease, at Jackfield, and chapels for Baptists,
Independents, and Methodists.  The market is held on Wednesday, and a
fair on the last Tuesday in April.  The parish of Broseley contained, in
1841, 4,829 inhabitants, and in 1851, 4,739.

MADELEY, or _Madeley Market_, is a parish, in the same franchise as
Broseley—the town extending to COALBROOKDALE, which is accounted a part
of it, and connected therewith in its trade and history.  The iron works
in this parish are considerable, and employ a great number of hands.  The
Coalbrookdale Company, so celebrated for the beautiful specimens of
wrought iron, which were sent by them to the Great Exhibition of 1851,
have their works here.  The famous iron bridge, which at this place
bestrides the Severn, and gives name to a part of the parish, was
constructed here in 1779.  All the principal parts were erected in three
months, without any accident to the works or workmen, or the least
obstruction to the navigation of the river.  The span of the arch is one
hundred feet six inches, and the height, from the base line to the
centre, forty feet, the total weight of iron being three hundred and
seventy-eight tons.  This fine work has every claim to attention as an
effort of great mechanical genius.  Madeley had at one time a well
attended market, which was removed by the lord of the manor (Joseph
Reynolds, Esq.) to IRONBRIDGE, a place of rising importance in this
parish, situated on the banks of the Severn.  The magistrates assemble in
petty sessions at Ironbridge every sixth week on a Tuesday, and Madeley
is included in the twenty-seventh circuit of county Court towns under the
new acts for the recovery of debts not exceeding £50.  A railway (which
will be of great importance to this district) is projected—it will run
from Shrewsbury to Kidderminster, and will be called the Severn Valley
fine.  The places of worship are the parish church of Saint Michael; the
new church of Saint Luke at Ironbridge, and one at Coalbrookdale,
dedicated to the Holy Trinity; and chapels for the Society of Friends,
Roman Catholics, and Wesleyan Methodists.  The living of Madeley is a
discharged vicarage, in the gift of Sir Edward Kynaston, Bart.  The House
of Industry, erected here in 1797, at a cost of £1,000., is a convenient
building.

At COALPORT, two miles from Ironbridge, are the china manufactories,
which are well worth the inspection of the visitant; as indeed is the
whole of this curious and romantic neighbourhood; where may be seen
winding glens, vast hills, and hanging woods: while the bosom of the
noble Severn, which so essentially contributes to the prosperity of this
district, in bearing away the articles produced here, adds also to the
general beauty of the country through which it glides.  There is also a
chair manufactory belonging to Messrs. Edge & Son, who were awarded a
prize medal at the Great Exhibition of 1851.  The market is held on
Friday at Ironbridge, and a fair at Madeley May 29th.  The parish of
Madeley contained, in 1841, 7,368 inhabitants, and in 1851, 8,522.

BENTHALL is a parish—the village being situated within the liberties of
Wenlock, nearly four miles from the town of that name.  There are pottery
works in this neighbourhood, which give employment to many of the
inhabitants; and the river Severn, which flows through the parish,
provides the means of distributing the articles manufactured to various
parts.  The parish church of St. Bartholomew is the only place of
worship.  The living of Benthall is a perpetual curacy, in the gift of
the vicar of Much Wenlock; the Rev. William H. Wayne is the present
incumbent.  Population of the parish, according to the returns made in
1841, 587, and by those for 1851, 530.

DAWLEY MAGNA is a populous parish, comprising the townships of DAWLEY
PARVA or LITTLE DAWLEY, and MALINS LEE, and the market town of DAWLEY or
DAWLEY GREEN—the last named situated about two miles N. from Madeley, and
four miles W. by S. from Shiffnall, a station on the Shrewsbury and
Chester and the Shrewsbury and Birmingham railways.  There are extensive
coal, iron, lime, and tile works in the parish, with numerous tram-roads
or railways in connection with them.  The parish church of St. Leonard
(or the Holy Trinity) is situated in Dawley Parva, and there are chapels
of ease at Little Dawley and Malins Lee.  The living of Dawley Magna is a
perpetual curacy, in the gift, conjointly, of two private families.  The
market is held on Saturday, and a fair on the 4th of June.  The parish
contained, in 1841, 8,641 inhabitants, and in 1851, 9,201.

CHURCH STRETTON,
INCLUDING THE TOWNSHIPS OF ALL STRETTON, LITTLE STRETTON, MINTON AND
NEIGHBOURHOODS.


CHURCH STRETTON is a parish in the hundred of Munslow, comprising the
township of its name, and also, those of ALL STRETTON, LITTLE STRETTON,
and MINTON: the market town of Church Stretton is 153 miles N.W. from
London, and 13 S. from Shrewsbury; romantically seated in a valley formed
by the Caradoc, Ragleth, and Longmynd hills.  It is a station on the
Shrewsbury and Hereford Railway.  From the summit of the latter, which is
nearly 1,700, feet above the level of the sea, most extensive,
interesting, and diversified views are commanded.  Many flocks of sheep
are kept on the hills, producing large quantities of good wool.  This
place, which is distinguished by its adjunct (Church), from its
townships, as the locality of the parish church, derives its name from
_Street-Town_, from its situation, within a quarter of a mile of the
_Watling-street_, which ancient way passes in a direction parallel with
the road from Shrewsbury to Ludlow.  The town consists of but one street,
in the widest part of which stands the market hall and public room,
erected in 1839, by subscription, on the site of an old timber structure.
The most prominent branch carried on is malting.  A court leet is held
twice in each year under the steward of the manor, and the county
magistrates sit in petty sessions on the third Thursday, monthly, at the
Crown, the principal inn here.  Church Stretton is a polling station at
the election of members to represent South Salop.

The parish church of Saint Lawrence is an ancient and venerable cruciform
structure, principally in the early style of English architecture, with a
square embattled tower, rising from the centre, crowned with pinnacles.
The chancel is ornamented with richly carved oak in antique devices; and
in the central compartment of the altar, is the representation of a dead
Christ in the lap of the Virgin, finely carved.  The windows, principally
in the decorated style, with rich tracery, are embellished with stained
glass, and in the south transept the ancient carved oak roof is carefully
preserved.  A large stone coffin, having a lid, and an alabaster slab
with an inscription, not legible, were discovered some years since
beneath this transept.  The triennial visitation is held in this church,
by the bishop of this diocess, in August, and in the intermediate years
by the archdeacon, in May.  Many of the valuable embellishments of the
church have been bestowed by the rector at a considerable expense.  The
living is a rectory in the gift of C. O. Child Pemberton; the present
incumbent is the Rev. Hugh Owen Wilson.  The free school, here, was
endowed by several benefactions: the present establishment combines the
objects of a National, with the advantage of a Sunday School, and is open
to all children of the parish; the inhabitants have also the advantage of
a public library and news room.  The other charities are almshouses for
four poor people, and some bequests, from which the poor of the parish
derive benefit at certain periods.  The air of this district is
considered exceedingly salubrious; the soil is a fine gravel, and several
clear mountain streams descend impetuously into the valleys.  The
secluded and romantic situation of the place, and its proximity to scenes
of deep interest, together with its healthfulness, render it a place of
resort for parties from the neighbouring towns.  The market is held on
Thursday; and the fairs on the Tuesday before Shrewsbury March fair; May
14th, July 3rd (for wool), September 25th, and the last Thursday in
November.  The parish (including the townships before mentioned),
contained in 1841, 1,604 inhabitants and in 1851, 1,676.

POST OFFICE, CHURCH STRETTON, Margaret Broome, _Post Mistress_.—Letters
from LONDON and all parts arrive (from SHREWSBURY), every morning at six,
and are despatched thereto at eight in the evening.

CLEOBURY MORTIMER


IS a parish in the hundred of Stoddesdon—the market town, a small one, is
137 miles N.W. from London, 33 S.S.E. from Shrewsbury, and 11 E. from
Ludlow, situated on the road from the metropolis to the latter town,
close to the southern border of the county, abutting upon Worcestershire,
and on an eminence rising gradually from the western hank of the river
Rea, which is crossed by a neat stone bridge.  The country around here is
very productive, and its fertility is promoted by the river, and by
numerous fine springs that rise in this neighbourhood.  The name of the
place is said to be derived from its situation, in a district abounding
with clay, and from the Saxon word _byrig_, a town; the adjunct, by which
it is distinguished from North Cleobury, is obtained from its ancient
possessor, Ralph de Mortimer, who held it at the time of the general
survey.  The town consists principally of one long street, in which are
some good houses, and the mutilated remains of an old cross.  The
government of the town is vested in a constable, who is annually
appointed at the court-leet of the lord of the manor, William Lacon
Childe, Esq.  This town is included in the twenty-seventh circuit of
County Court towns, for the recovery of debts not exceeding £50.
Formerly this was a place of good trade, having extensive iron works;
these have disappeared, and, with the exception of the extensive paper
works belonging to Mr. Thomas Lambert Hall, jun., and which affords
employment to a considerable number of hands, the town is not
distinguished by any manufactures.  The malting business is carried on by
a few individuals; and on the Clee hills, about three miles west, are
collieries, producing good coal, but the works have little or no
influence upon the trade of the town.

The parish church of St. Mary is an ancient structure, with a plain
square tower, surmounted by an octagonal spire of wood, and formerly
belonged to one of the mitred abbeys.  The living is a vicarage, in the
gift of the lord of the manor; the Rev. Edward George Childe is the
present incumbent.  There is a chapel each for Methodists and Roman
Catholics—the latter is attached to Mawley Hall, about a mile to the
west, the seat of Sir Edward Blount, Bart.  The locality of this hall is
very beautiful, and the prospects extensive and pleasing.  The endowed
school was founded pursuant to the will of Sir William Lacon Childe,
Knight, dated 1714; and in 1740 the ground was purchased on which the
buildings are erected: it is a well endowed establishment, and educates
upwards of two hundred pupils, of whom forty boys and girls are annually
clothed; and a fee is given for apprenticing boys on their leaving the
school.  The present income (including land) amounts to about £500. per
annum: the management is vested in ten trustees: the head master is
appointed by W. L. Childe, Esq., as representative of the founder, and
visitor of the schools.  The market is held on Wednesday, and the fairs
April 21st, May 2nd, Trinity Monday, and October 27th.  The parish
contained, in 1841, 1,730 inhabitants, and in 1851, 1,738.

CLUN AND NEIGHBOURHOOD.


CLUN is a parish in the hundred of Purslow—the market town, which was a
borough, incorporated by the Lords Marchers, in the thirteenth century,
is 157 miles N.W. from London, 26 S.S.W. from Shrewsbury, and 16 W. by N.
from Ludlow; pleasantly and rather romantically situated on a gentle
eminence surrounded by hills of bolder elevation.  It takes its name from
the river Colun or Clun (by the Welsh called _Colunwy_), which passes
through the town, and is crossed by an ancient bridge of five arches.
The castle, according to Camden, was built by William Fitz-Alan, Earl of
Arundel in the reign of Henry III, and is supposed to have been
demolished by Owen Glyndwr, in his rebellion against Henry IV.: it
continued in the line of Fitz-Alan until the reign of Elizabeth, when, by
the marriage of Mary Fitz-Alan to Philip Howard, son of Thomas, Duke of
Norfolk, it became vested in that noble family.  It is now a most
magnificent ruin; the remains consist of the lofty and massive walls of
the keep, the banquet-hall, and part of two round towers.  This castle
and neighbourhood is conjectured to have been the scene of Sir Walter
Scott’s much admired tale of ‘the Betrothed.’  In the parish are the Caer
Ditches, or _Caer Carodoc_, the station of the renowned British hero,
Caractacus, and the scene of his last efforts against the Roman general
Ostorius; and about two miles west of the town passes the great dyke
thrown up by the Saxon king Offa in the eighth century.  The government
under its ancient incorporation was vested in a high steward, two
bailiffs, a recorder, and the burgesses, assisted by a town clerk, two
serjeants at mace, &c.  The steward is now the principal governing
officer, but the court of record for adjudicating claims has been
superseded by the new County Court, which sits at Bishop’s Castle, and
takes cognizance of debts to any amount not exceeding £50.  The Earl
Powis is lord of the lordship or honour of Clun, and holds his courts for
the same at certain periods; and Clun is a polling station at the
election of members to represent South Salop.

The parish church of Saint George is a venerable pile, partially
destroyed by Fleetwood, one of Cromwell’s generals, and never since
perfectly restored.  The most ancient part is the nave, which is of a
very early date, probably anterior to the Norman conquest.  The side
aisles are purely in the early English style, and one of them has a very
handsome roof and canopy.  In the interior are some neat monuments, and
it possesses an organ and a choir of singers.  The church is surmounted
by a low tower, containing a peal of six fine bells.  It formerly was
connected with Wenlock abbey, and at the dissolution of religious houses
the great tithes were alienated from the church, and are now in the
possession of the Earl Powis, who is the patron of the living which is a
vicarage; the present incumbent is the Honourable Rev. George Herbert,
brother of the patron.  The other places of worship are a chapel of ease
in the town, another in the township of NEWCASTLE, and the Wesleyan and
Primitive Methodists have one each.  Adjoining the town is Clun Hospital,
dedicated to the Holy and Undivided Trinity, founded in the year 1613 by
the Right Honbl. Henry Howard, Earl of Northampton, for the maintenance
of fourteen old men and a warden.  The building consists of sixteen
distinct dwellings for the old men, a house for the warden, a chapel and
a dining hall forming a quadrangle.  The old men receive £2. per month,
are provided with a garden and fuel, and have other perquisites.  The
management is vested in the rector of Hopesay, the vicar of Clun, and the
vicar and bailiff of Bishop’s Castle; the bishop of Hereford is visitor.
The market is held on Tuesday; and the fairs, May 11th, Whit-Tuesday,
September 23rd, and November 22nd, for cattle, sheep, pigs and pedlary.
The parish contained in 1841, 2,077 inhabitants and in 1851, 2,121.

DRAYTON,
WITH THE VILLAGE OF HODNET AND NEIGHBOURHOODS.


DRAYTON, or MARKET DRAYTON, is a market town, in the parish of Drayton in
Hales—which latter is partly in the hundred of Bradford North, in the
county of Salop, and partly in the northern division of the hundred of
Pirehill, county of Stafford; 151 miles N.W. by N. from London, 19 N.E.
by N. from Shrewsbury, 20 N.W. from Stafford, 9 W.S.W. from Whitmore, a
first class station on the London and North-Western Railway, and 18 S.W.
from Newcastle-under-Lyme, which town is about a mile and a half from the
line of the North Staffordshire Railway; situated on the north-western
bank of the river Tern.  In Domesday book this place is called
_Druitune_; and the manor belonged successively to the abbot of St.
Ebrulph, in Normandy, and the abbot of Combermere in Cheshire; and it was
from the latter that it received the grant of a market and fair.  Blore
heath, about two miles from the town, was the scene of a sanguinary
battle between the houses of York and Lancaster; the latter, with a force
of ten thousand men, being defeated by the Yorkists, with only half that
number.  At one period, the town enjoyed considerable business, and had
one of the best markets in this district, but in consequence of the
construction of the Grand Trunk canal its trade declined.  Under the head
of manufactures, all that can be mentioned is that for hair-cloth; there
are several corn mills and maltings, and two iron foundries, one of
which, Messrs. William and John Rodenhurst, employ upwards of one hundred
hands.  The petty sessions for the Drayton division of the hundred are
held here monthly, and the town is included in the twenty-seventh circuit
of County Court towns, under the acts for the recovery of debts to any
amount, not exceeding £50.  The inhabitants of the Staffordshire portion
of the parish have the privilege of proving wills before a steward or
judge, appointed by the lord of the manor, which custom is recorded to
have existed prior to the year 1680.

The parish church of Saint Mary, supposed to have been erected, with the
exception of the steeple, in the reign of Stephen, consists of a nave,
aisles, a chancel, and a square tower; the latter supported by
buttresses, and ornamented with battlements and pinnacles: the living is
a vicarage, in the patronage of Richard Corbet, Esq.; the Rev. James Lee,
M.A. is the present incumbent.  Christ church, Little Drayton, first
opened for divine service, in 1847, was erected partly by subscription,
and partly by the aid of the incorporated society for building and
enlarging churches and chapels, who granted £325., and the late Mrs.
Nunneley, a benevolent lady, contributed the munificent sum of £1,000.
It is a neat structure, consisting of a nave, chancel and aisles: the
living is a perpetual curacy, at present enjoyed by the Rev. Edward
Cheere.  The situation of the parsonage is remarkably pleasant, and
commands a fine and extensive view over a delightful country.  The
charities comprise a free grammar school, founded and endowed in 1554, by
Sir Rowland Hill; several bequests for clothing the poor, an
apprenticeship fund, and two schools, conducted upon the national plan.
There are several seats and many handsome residences in the neighbourhood
of Drayton, and the country around is fertile, diversified by hill and
dale, and fine open plains.  The market, formerly of greater note than at
present, is held on Wednesday; and the fairs on the Wednesday before Palm
Sunday; the Wednesday before 22nd of June, September 19th, and October
24th, for horned cattle, horses, sheep, pigs, and hempen and woollen
cloth.  The fairs, more recently established, are held on the first
Wednesdays, in February, March and August, and the last Wednesday in
November.  The parish of Drayton in Hales contained, in 1841, 4,680, and
in 1851 (including Tyrley in Staffordshire, 784), 4,947 inhabitants.

HODNET is a parish, in the hundred of Bradford North—the village a small
one, is situated 6 miles S.W. from Drayton, on the Shrewsbury road.  The
parish church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, is a very ancient structure
and several handsome monuments ornament the interior, the living is a
rectory; the present incumbent is the Rev. S. H. Macauley.  Fairs are
held on the Monday before the second Wednesday in March, May 4th, and the
Monday before the 24th of October.  The parish of Hodnet contained, in
1841, 2,185, and in 1851, 2,087.

ELLESMERE AND NEIGHBOURHOOD.


ELLESMERE is a market town and parish, in the hundred of Pimhill, 169
miles N.W. from London, 16 N.N.W. from Shrewsbury, and 12 from Wrexham;
situate near the north-western extremity of the county, contiguous to
Flintshire.  The town is of Saxon origin, and supposed to derive its name
from the water called _Ailsmere_, i.e. the greatest mere—being the most
extensive lake in this part of the country; it covers about one hundred
and sixteen acres, and is well stocked with fish.  Its environs have two
advantages superior to other lakes; a good town borders on one side, and
the beautiful park of Oteley on the other.  A mansion, in the
Elizabethian style, erected by the owner of the property, Charles
Kynaston Mainwaring, Esq., and a tower of considerable height immediately
adjoining it (commemorative of the birth of his son and heir), form
picturesque objects from the town: the park is also a fine one,
strikingly diversified with hill and dale.  Near the mere is a house of
industry for the poor of five parishes, from which is a delightful
prospect; and on the Castle-hill is one of the finest bowling-greens in
the kingdom from which nine different counties may be seen.  The green
occupies the site of the keep of the ancient castle, a frontier fortress
during the unsettled period which preceded the final subjugation of
Wales, and was probably demolished about the close of the parliamentary
war.  Ellesmere formerly gave name to a hundred, which, with its
dependencies, was annexed to that of Pimhill, in the 27th year of Henry
VIII.  Part of the manor of St. John of Jerusalem extends to the town and
liberties of Ellesmere, which is exclusively governed by its bailiffs,
chosen annually by a jury at a court-leet of the lord of the manor.  The
ancient hundred court for the recovery of small debts has been superseded
by the new county court, in which claims are adjudicated to any amount
not exceeding £50.  The town has an aspect of respectability and comfort:
it is gas-lighted, and the houses are in general neat and well
constructed.  In 1833 a handsome building was completed for a town-hall
and market-house, the ground floor being for the accommodation of those
who have butter, poultry, &c. for sale; while the upper portion is
appropriated to public meetings and occasional assemblies.  The principal
trade of Ellesmere is malting; the barley of the neighbourhood being
remarkably good, a corresponding demand for the malt is generally
experienced; and the butter and cheese produced in this part of the
country are of the finest description.  There are several excellent inns,
the chief of which is the Bridgewater Arms.  This place is in some
measure benefited by a navigation, called the Ellesmere canal, which
forms a communication between the river Dee at Chester and the Severn at
Shrewsbury, and by collateral branches to all parts of the kingdom.  The
canal was constructed, in pursuance of an act of parliament, in the 34th
of George III.

The parish church of St. Mary is an ancient structure, in the decorative
style of English architecture, with a lofty square tower in the centre,
wherein is a ring of eight bells: the east window is a fine composition
in the later style.  The living is a vicarage, in the patronage of Lord
Alford; the present vicar is the Rev. John David Day.  The other places
of worship are for Independents, and Primitive, Association, and Wesleyan
Methodists.  The chapelries of COCKSHUT, DUDLASTON, and PENLEY (the
last-named in the county of Flint), belonging to this parish, are all
perpetual curacies.  There are two schools for children of either sex,
conducted upon the National plan.  Ellesmere is the centre of an Union
under the new Poor-Law, consisting of seventeen parishes, nine of which
are in Salop, and the remainder in Flintshire.  The population of the
Union, at the last census, amounted to 15,226.  The market is held on
Tuesday, and the fairs on the Tuesday after the 2nd of February, the
third Tuesday in April, Tuesday in Whitsun-week, the first Tuesday in
July, the last Tuesday in August, the first Tuesday in October, the third
Tuesday in November, and the first Tuesday in December.  Ellesmere parish
contained (including the chapelries before mentioned), in 1841, 6,603
inhabitants, and in 1851, 6,940.

POST OFFICE, Scotland-street, Andrew Bickley, _Post Master_.—Letters from
all parts arrive (from SHREWSBURY) every morning at ten minutes before
seven, and are despatched at a quarter before six in the evening.

HALES OWEN (Worcestershire),
WITH THE VILLAGES OF CRADLEY, NETHEREND, AND NEIGHBOURHOODS.


HALES OWEN, (formerly in the county of Salop), in a market town and
parish—the latter insulated, separated from Shropshire, and entirely
surrounded by Staffordshire and Worcestershire, and extending into the
hundred of Haltshire, in the latter county, to which it was in 1844,
annexed by act of parliament; 117 miles N.W. from London, 11 S. by E.
from Wolverhampton, 5 S. by E. from Dudley, and 7 S.W. from Birmingham,
and 5 from Stourbridge—the last named is the nearest railway station, it
being on the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton line.  This place is
said to have formerly been a borough, though it does not appear to have
ever returned members to the legislature.  The town, which is seated in a
fertile valley, consists principally of one street, in which are some
respectable houses, and of several smaller streets, containing humbler
dwellings, irregularly built.  The river Stour, which rises in some hills
not far distant, passes the town, as does the Netherton canal; about half
a mile from it.  Lord Lyttleton is lord of the manor, and holds an annual
court leet, when a high and low bailiff, a constable, and head-borough
are appointed.  A court for the recovery of debts under £5., the
jurisdiction of which included Hales Owen, is held at the court-house,
Oldbury, once a fortnight, but this is now become inoperative, by the
acts of the new County Court under which debts are recoverable to any
amount, not exceeding £50.  This place has been noted for the manufacture
of nails, chains, and pearl and horn buttons.  There are also, extensive
iron works, (including the British Iron Company), and manufactories for
gun-barrels, wrought iron hinges, anvils and vices, hammers and files,
spades, shovels, &c.  The coal trade is of importance; bricks and tiles
are made to a considerable extent; and there are several maltings and
corn mills, in the town and neighbourhood.

The parish church of Saint John, (which has recently undergone a thorough
repair), is said to have been erected prior to the Conquest, contains a
beautiful monument to the memory of Major Halliday, and a plain one to
Shenstone the poet; the benefice is a vicarage, in the patronage of Lord
Lyttleton, and incumbency of the Rev. Richard Brindley Hone.  There are
places of worship for Independents, and Wesleyan and Primitive
Methodists.  The free grammar school here, was founded under a commission
for charitable uses.  At a short distance from the town are the
‘Leassowes,’ the seat of the celebrated Shenstone, who received the
rudiments of his education in the Hales Owen grammar school, it is now
occupied by William Matthews, Esq. The market, which at the present day
is of little or no importance, is chartered to be held on Monday (now
held on Saturday); and a fair on Easter Monday.  The entire parish of
Hales Owen contained in 1841, 17,376 and in 1851, 23,330 (this is
inclusive of Oldbury township which of itself contained at the last named
period 10,155.)

CRADLEY is a chapelry, in that part of the parish of Hales Owen which is
in the lower division of the hundred of Haltshire, county of Worcester;
two miles N.N.W. from Hales Owen, and three from Dudley and Stourbridge;
situated on the river Stour, which, running on the northern and western
sides of the chapelry, separates it from the county of Stafford.
Beautifully situated in a woody district, and pleasing walks, and on the
banks of a large pool or artificial lake, is Cradley Spa, where warm and
cold baths have been erected; the water is impregnated with sulphate of
soda, magnesia, &c., and is much used by invalids during the summer.  At
one period, an attempt was made to manufacture salt here, but with very
partial success.  Tin making of nails and chains now constitute the
staple of the chapelry.  The places of worship are the chapel under the
establishment, and three others for dissenters: the living is a perpetual
curacy, of which the Rev. Charles Walker Simons, is the incumbent.  A
national school, established here, is supported by subscription.  The
soil of this district is fertile, and brick clay of an excellent quality
is obtained.  The population of the chapelry, in 1851, was 3,383.

NETHEREND is a small village in Cradley chapelry, adjacent to Hales Owen;
and is chiefly to be noticed as having in its vicinity the extensive iron
works of Messrs. Evers & Sons, for the manufacture of tar, rolled, and
slit iron, for horse nails &c. which furnish employment to many hands,
and others are engaged in the malting trade, it also contains extensive
coal and brick works.  In the village is a chapel for Unitarians, and a
free school.  Population returned with Cradley chapelry.

LUDLOW,
WITH THE VILLAGES OF BROMFIELD, STANTON LACY, ONIBURY, AND
NEIGHBOURHOODS.


LUDLOW is a market town, and borough, both corporate and parliamentary,
having separate jurisdiction, locally in the hundred of Munslow; 143
miles N.W. by N. from London, and 29 S. by E. from Shrewsbury, and a
station on the Shrewsbury and Hereford Railway.  It is pleasantly
situated on an eminence, in a fertile and picturesque district,
commanding a variety of beautiful prospects.  The ancient British name of
this place was _Dynan Llys Twysog_, or the ‘Prince’s Palace,’ and is
supposed to have been the residence of some prince of the country, prior
to the subjugation of Wales by Edward I.  By the Saxons it was called
_Leadlowe_, _Ludelaue_, and _Ludlowe_, which last name, with a slight
variation, it still retains.  The town is about a mile in length, and was
formerly surrounded by a wall, with towers at certain distances; some
part of the wall still remains, but the towers have long since
disappeared, as have also the gates (which were seven in number), with
the exception of one called Broadgate.  The streets are mostly wide and
well paved, lying in a diverging and inclined direction from the highest,
or central part of the town.  The houses are in general well built, and
some elegant, while all are more regularly disposed than in most inland
towns of the same antiquity.  The town is lighted with gas, and several
of the public buildings of Ludlow are remarkably neat structures.  Nearly
in the centre of the town, at the top of Broad-street, stands the cross a
handsome stone erection; and in Castle-street is the market-house, a
large building, beneath which is an area, serving as a corn-market, and
the upper rooms, which are commodious, are used for the corporation
meetings, balls, assemblies, &c.  Two handsome buildings, originating
with some spirited gentlemen of the town, were erected in Mill-street and
Castle-street, as public rooms, and they include a subscription library,
conservative reading rooms; together with spacious ball and refreshment
rooms.  The museum of the natural history society, a valuable collection,
is arranged within the building in Mill street; and here likewise are the
offices of the savings’ bank; the mechanics’ institute is in
Castle-street—they are all flourishing establishments.  The Guildhall,
where the quarter sessions and other courts are held, is a neat,
commodious, modern structure.  To the west of the church stands a range
of buildings, called the College, and there is a prison, named Gaolford’s
tower, a commodious edifice, erected by the corporation in 1764.  But the
object of perhaps the greatest interest, both to the inhabitants of
Ludlow and the visitor, and that to which the town owed its early
importance, is the castle; which stands on a bold wooded rock, at the
north-west angle of the town, and commands extensive and lovely
prospects.  It was founded according to the generally received opinion,
by Roger de Montgomery, about the year 1130, who strongly environed it by
lofty embattled walls of great thickness, with towers at convenient
distances.  This noble baronial fortress now presents a mass of
magnificent ruins, retaining, however, ample assurance of its former
extent and glory.  Along the sides of the castle eminence, are public
walks, laid out in 1772, at the instigation of the Countess Powis, Lucien
Buonaparte, his family and suite, when prisoners of war in this country,
occupied the house belonging to the Earl Powis, adjoining the castle.

The manufacture of gloves, which at one time was considerable, is now
extinct.  Malting at the present time may be taken as the principal
branch, and there are several mills for grinding corn, upon the Teme,
which river runs close to the town.  A brass and iron foundry, one
ropery, and two tanneries, may be mentioned as the other chief
branches—exclusive of the general business (supported in a respectable
town); and the inns, of which latter there are several excellent ones.
On the Clee hills, about six miles from the town, are coal mines.  The
inhabitants received a charter of incorporation from Edward IV, which
remained in force until the Municipal Reform Act (passed in 1835), vested
the government of the borough in a mayor, four aldermen, and twelve
councillors, assisted by a recorder, and other officers.  Quarter
sessions are held, at which capital offences can be tried; and there is a
court of record every Tuesday, for the recovery of debts to any amount:
in both these courts the recorder presides as judge.  The debt court,
however, has become inoperative, if not superseded by the new County
Court—Ludlow being included in the twenty-seventh circuit of towns under
the acts for recovery of debts to any amount not exceeding £50.  The
burgesses first exercised the elective franchise in the 12th of Edward
IV, since which time they have continued to send two members: the present
members are Lord William P. F. Powlett, 19 Curzon-street, May Fair,
London, and Col. the Honourable P. E. Herbert, 45 Berkeley-square,
London.  Races are held annually on the 17th of August, and efforts are
being made to establish races also in the month of November, and a small
theatre is open in Mill-street during the race meeting.

The parish church of Saint Lawrence (formerly collegiate), a very
spacious and elegant cruciform edifice, appears to have been built in the
reigns of Henry VII. and VIII.  From the centre rises a lofty square
tower, embattled and handsomely embellished: this tower adds, in no small
degree, to the beauty of many of the views in the surrounding country.
In the chancel are several fine monuments of the Lords Presidents of the
council of Wales, who resided in the neighbouring castle.  The living is
a rectory, in the gift of the Crown; the Rev. John Phillips is the
present incumbent, and the Rev. Robert W. Russell, B.C.L. is the
lecturer.  There are places of worship for Independents, and Wesleyan and
Primitive Methodists.  Almshouses, containing thirty-three apartments for
indigent persons, founded by Mr. John Hosier, merchant; others, called
Fox’s almshouses, erected in 1590, and a well sustained dispensary for
the sick poor, are among the charities of Ludlow.  The grammar school, an
excellent foundation, in Mill-street, is under the regulations of a
charter granted by Edward IV. by which both the ancient and modern
languages are taught; and in a national school are instructed a
considerable number of children of both sexes.  The healthful situation
of the town and the beauty of the surrounding country have been the means
of inducing numerous families, of independent fortune, to make Ludlow and
its vicinage their residence.  The principal seats in the neighbourhood
are Oakley Park, two miles hence, the property of the Hon. Robert Henry
Clive, M.P.; Ludford House, Francis Lechmere Chariton, Esq.; Caynham
Court, Sir William Curtis, Bart. and Downton Hall, Sir W. E. R. Boughton,
Bart.  The principal market, which is for grain, is held on Monday; and
the smaller markets for provisions on Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday.
The fairs are the Monday before 13th February, Tuesday before Easter,
Wednesday in Whitsun-week, May 1st, August 21st, September 28th, the
first Monday in November, and December 6th.  Large quantities of butter
and cheese are brought to the first and last mentioned fairs, and hops,
cattle, horses, sheep, and pigs, to the others.  The municipal borough of
Ludlow (which consists of the parish of St. Laurence), contained, in
1841, 5,064 inhabitants, and in 1851, 4,691, being a decrease of 373, but
the parliamentary borough (which consists of the parish of St. Laurence,
part of the parish of Bromfield, of Stanton Lacy and of Ludford, part in
the county of Salop, and part in the county of Hereford), contained, in
1851, 5,376

BROMFIELD is a village in the parish of its name 3 miles N.W. by W. from
Ludlow.  The parish church dedicated to St. Mary is part of a larger
conventual church that belonged to Benedictine Priory, founded about
1155, a small portion of the ruins is included within the grounds of
Oakley Park.  The living is a vicarage in the gift of Earl Powis.
Population of the parish in 1851 was 682, of which number 541 was
returned for the village.

STANTON LACY is a parish 3 miles N.N.W. from Ludlow.  The parish church
is dedicated to St. Peter.  The living is a vicarage in the gift of the
Earl of Craven.  The population of the parish in 1851, was 1,556.

ONIBURY is a parish 5½ miles N.W. from Ludlow.  The parish church is
dedicated to St. Michael; the living is a vicarage in the gift of the
Bishop of Hereford.  A court baron is occasionally held here.  The

NEWPORT AND NEIGHBOURHOOD.


NEWPORT is a borough corporate, market-town and parish, in the Newport
division of the hundred of Bradford South; 139 miles N.W. by W. from
London, and 19 E.N.E. from Shrewsbury; situated near the line of the
Roman _Watling street_, at the north-eastern border of the county, on a
branch of the Liverpool and Birmingham Junction Canal.  The Shropshire
Union Railway passes through the upper end of the town, from Stafford to
Shrewsbury; it is a branch held on lease by the London and North Western,
and was opened for traffic in June, 1849.  The town, which is seated in a
delightful part of the country, sustained, in the year 1665, damage by
fire to the amount of upwards of £30,000.—a very large sum at that
period.  Its appearance now is respectable, having many handsome
dwellings, two proprietary banking establishments, a bank for savings, a
spacious market-hall, and good inns; the principal is the ‘Royal Victoria
Hotel’ (and posting house), in Saint Mary street, which as a commercial
and family house can be classed amongst the first in Shropshire.  The
‘Raven and Bell’ in the High street, is also a most respectable inn,
affording excellent accommodation.  The principal manufactories are one
belonging to William Scott Underhill, agricultural implement
manufacturer, in Saint Mary street, and another of the same to Jones &
Aston, of Salters lane; there is also an extensive iron and brass
foundry, and two manufactories for bend ware, and various turnery, hair
sieves, &c. of the most approved description.  A newspaper is published
weekly, by H. P. & C. Sylvester, entitled ‘the Newport and North
Shropshire Advertiser,’ and enjoys a large circulation.

The liberties and privileges of the town commenced by grants, as early as
Henry I, and they have been confirmed by succeeding monarchs.  The
corporation comprises a high steward, deputy steward, two bailiffs and
about twenty-five burgesses, who are entitled to certain property within
the parish, the rents arising from which, are chiefly applied to defray
the expense of keeping in repair a water-course and pipes, by which, from
a spring about a mile distance, the inhabitants are supplied with
water—this is conveyed into five large cisterns, placed in different
parts of the town, four of which were erected and beautified under the
direction of the corporation, at a considerable expense, and are rendered
an ornament, as well as a convenience to the inhabitants.  There is also
derived from a large tract of land, a fund which is applied, amongst
other purposes, to the repairs of the streets, lighting the town, and
apprenticing poor children.  His Grace the Duke of Sutherland is lord of
the manor, and holds courts leet annually.  Petty sessions, for the
Newport division of the hundred, are held here by the magistrates, and
the County Court, under the new acts, sits one a month in the town hall,
for the recovery of debts to any amount not exceeding £50.

The parish Church of Saint Nicholas, formerly belonged to the abbey of
Saint Peter and Saint Paul, in Shrewsbury, and was alienated by
permission of Henry VI, to Thomas Draper and his heirs, by whom it was
made collegiate for a warden and four lay chaplains.  The church is
principally in the ancient style of English architecture with a square
tower, and was repaired and beautified in 1827, at a cost exceeding
£3,000, and again in 1835; the living is a perpetual curacy, in the
patronage of the Crown; the present incumbent is the Rev. William
Sandford, A.M.  There are places of worship for Independents, Roman
Catholics, and Methodists—both Primitive and Wesleyan.  The school here
was founded, and amply endowed, in 1656, by William Adams, Esq. a native
of Newport, who assigned certain lands for the support of a master and an
usher, for the endowment of four exhibitions at any of the colleges in
Oxford or Cambridge, for the erection and support of four almshouses for
that number of that number of poor persons, for annually apprenticing
three poor children, and for other purposes.  This school also enjoys the
benefit of four other exhibitions, founded by Mr. Careswell.  The land
belonging to this charity yields an annual income of nearly £1,000.
There are the town’s almshouses for four poor females, founded and
erected in 1446, by William Glover, of this town; a national school,
originating from a free grammar school of very ancient foundation, and
several other charities and funds vested in trustees.  Newport under the
new Poor Law, is the centre of an Union, comprising sixteen parishes; and
a new and commodious workhouse has been erected.  The town is indebted to
the same gentleman who so munificently endowed the free school, for its
market hall.  The country around here is very fertile, the prospects
beautiful, and enriched by many seats of note; and among other subjects
worthy of observation in the neighbourhood, are the ruins of Saint John’s
abbey at Lilleshall, about three miles hence.  The market is held on
Saturday; cattle and sheep fairs (or markets), every alternate Tuesday,
and annual fairs on the first Tuesday after Candlemas, the Saturday
before Palm-Sunday, May 28th, July 27th, Sept. 25th, and December 10th,
principally for live stock.  The parish contained, by the returns
rendered in 1841, 2,497 inhabitants, and by those in 1851, 2,906.

OLDBURY SEE WORCESTERSHIRE.
OSWESTRY,
WITH THE VILLAGES OF WHITTINGTON, MORDA AND NEIGHBOURHOODS.


OSWESTRY is a borough corporate, market town and parish, having separate
jurisdiction, locally in the hundred of its name; 171 miles N.W. from
London, 18 N.W. from Shrewsbury. 16 N. from Welchpool, 15 S. from
Wrexham, and 12 S.E. from Llangollen.  It lies on the main road from
London to Holyhead, upon higher ground than any other town in Shropshire:
the country around is delightfully varied with hill, dale, wood, and
water—exhibiting some remarkable rich and picturesque scenery.  Oswestry
is of great antiquity, and its present appellation, which is a corruption
of _Oswaldstree_, was derived from the name of St. Oswald, King of
Northumberland, who was defeated and slain here by Penda, King of Mercia,
A.D. 642.  Subsequently, when the great Offa constructed the barrier
still known by his name, Oswestry stood between it and Watt’s dyke, which
ran parallel to the former, at the distance of two miles: it was thus
rendered a border town, and hence became frequently the scene of contest,
first between the Saxons and the Britons, and afterwards between the
latter and the Normans.  In 1212, under its Lord Fitz-Alan, it was taken
and burnt by King John, also by the Welch prince, Llewellyn, in 1233.
During this period it was encircled by a strong wall, which had four
gates, fronting the four cardinal points: some traces of the former may
still be seen, but the gates were entirely demolished about the year
1783.  Of the castle, which stood on a lofty artificial mount at the west
side of the town, only a few fragments now remain; these, however, are
sufficient to indicate its primitive strength, and consequent importance,
as a station of defence.  It may be said of Oswestry that it ranks as the
birth-place of the Stuart race of Kings.  Walter Fitz-Alan, founder of
Paisley monastery, whose descendants took the name of Stewart, from their
office of high ‘Stewards,’ of Scotland, was born here and flourished in
the reigns of Stephen, and Henry II.  A great part of the town was
destroyed by casual fires which occurred in 1542, 1544 and 1567.
Oswestry has been much improved since the year 1810, when an act was
obtained for widening, paving and lighting the streets, which gave an
impulse to the spirit of building.  In 1825 gas was introduced; and the
ancient structures of timber and brick have given place to respectable
modern edifices.  Additional improvements have since taken place, and
large and commodious market-places have been erected for the sale of
butter, cheese, poultry and butchers meat, for which the locality is well
adapted, possessing railway communication to all parts, by means of a
branch to the town from the Shrewsbury and Chester line, and having an
extensive Welsh agricultural district at its back.  The corn market is
situate in Bailey-square, and is a plain building, with a high clock
turret, and the roof is partly covered with glass.  A beautiful field of
two and a half acres, situated near the very centre of the town, is
appropriated as a ‘Smithfield’ for the cattle fairs.  A neat theatre is
generally opened in the autumn.  The races have been discontinued for the
last three years.

The first charter of incorporation was granted to the inhabitants by
William Fitz-Alan, in the reign of Henry II; the first royal charter was
conferred by Richard II, and a subsequent one by Charles II—under the
last mentioned the town was governed until the operation of the Municipal
Reform Act (passed in 1835), since when, the corporate body has consisted
of a mayor, six aldermen and eighteen councillors, with two
serjeant-at-mace, and the other usual assistant officers: the borough
under the same act, was divided into two wards, and provided with a
commission of the peace.  Petty sessions for the hundred are held, on the
last Thursday in every month, before the magistrates; and a county court,
under the new acts is held monthly, for the recovery of debts not
exceeding £50.  The Earl of Powis is lord of the manor.  Oswestry is a
polling station at the election of members to represent the northern
division of the county.  The sale of Welch flannel, and of cotton goods,
which was formerly carried on here to a great extent, has entirely
disappeared: at present the chief business of the place is malting.
There are many corn mills in the vicinity, where is also coal; and upon
the Morda stream is a manufactory for paper.  Two iron and brass
foundries give employment to a large number of persons.  There are four
excellent inns in the town—they are admirably conducted commercial and
family houses.

The parish church of Saint Oswald (or St. Mary), originally the
conventual church of the ancient monastery, was greatly damaged during
the commotions of 1616 and 1664; at which latter period the tower was
taken down by the royalists, this structure was enlarged and beautified
in 1807, and since that period it has undergone great improvements.  The
church contains many very handsome tablets and monumental inscriptions.
On the north side of the church yard is a pleasant walk, overshadowed
with a double row of lime trees, and terminated by an alcove.  The living
of Oswestry is a discharged vicarage, in the patronage of the Earl Powis;
the present incumbent is the Rev. Thomas Salwey.  The other places of
worship under the establishment are Saint Martin’s, and Trinity chapels,
with one at Trefonen and another at Hengoed.  There are several chapels
for dissenters, of which a list is appended.  The free grammar school
here, was founded about the time of Henry IV, by Davy Holbeck, who
endowed it; and it has been further enriched by subsequent subscriptions:
the school is free to all the sons of parishioners, for instruction in
English and classical literature.  A letter is still in existence, in the
hand-writing of Oliver Cromwell, resting the appointment of master of
this school in the corporation of Oswestry—how such appointment has
lapsed from the corporation is not ascertained.  The other principal
charities comprise a school, conducted upon the national plan, one on
that of the British and Foreign School Society, a house of industry, and
a valuable dispensary, carried on partly by the self-supporting system,
and partly by contributions.  There is an association for the prevention
of crime and the prosecution of felons.  It is remarked in ‘Tymm’s
Topography,’ that, in 1797, died John Lloyd, attorney, at Oswestry, the
original institutor of societies for the prosecution of felons—of which
that at Oswestry was the _first_.  This neighbourhood is remarkable for
its great respectability; and to the number of genteel and opulent
families that have residences in it, may in a great measure, be ascribed
the prosperity of the town itself.  The ‘Oswestry Advertiser’ newspaper,
is published every Wednesday, and is worthy of support for the local
information which it contains.  The News Room is at the Court House,
Bailey square.  The markets are held on Wednesday and Saturday; the
former is a good one for grain and other produce; the latter is for
butcher’s meat, as well as other commodities of domestic consumption.
Cattle fairs are held on the first Wednesday of every month.  The parish
(which comprises several townships) contained in 1841, 8,843 inhabitants,
and by the returns for 1851, 8,796.  The population of the township is
4,817.

WHITTINGTON is a parish, in the hundred of Oswestry—the village, two
miles and a half north-east from the town of that name, is chiefly to be
noticed for the remains of a castle, anciently belonging to the
Fitz-Warrens.  The ruins consist of one large tower, with traces of four
others, and the exterior gateway, now occupied by a farmer.  A station
belonging to the Shrewsbury and Chester Railway Company is in this
parish.  A church belonging to the establishment, a chapel for
Independents, and a national school are in the village.  The parish
contained in 1841, 1,953 inhabitants, and in 1851, 1,927,

SHIFFNALL,
WITH THE PARISH OF LILLESHALL, PAINS LANE, AND NEIGHBOURHOODS.


SHIFFNALL is a parish, in the hundred of Brimstree—the market town is 136
miles N.W. from London, 18 E. by S. from Shrewsbury (17¼ by rail), and 13
N.W. from Wolverhampton (12¼ by rail); situated on the Shrewsbury and
Birmingham railway, the line of which is carried over the market place by
a lofty and handsome iron bridge—and here is the passenger station.  The
town was anciently called _Idsali_, and is supposed to have been of
greater note and extent previous to its destruction by fire, which
circumstance is recorded in a book printed towards the end of the
fifteenth century, entitled ‘The Burnvnge of the Town of Idsall, _alias_
Shiffnall.’  Petty sessions are held here the first Friday in every
month, and a court leet annually by Lord Stafford, the owner of the
manor.  The County Court Act for the recovery of debts under £50.
includes Shiffnall within the Madeley circuit of towns.  The general
trade of the place is mainly supported by its own inhabitants, and by the
custom of the gentry and farmers residing in the surrounding country.  At
Priors-Lee, about three miles hence, the Lilleshall Company have their
office, and the iron and coal mines belonging to the establishment
approach to within two miles and a half of the town.

The parish church of Saint Andrew, is a large ancient cruciform
structure, with a tower rising from the centre: the prevailing style of
architecture is the later Norman, with many modern alterations.  In 1810,
the church was thoroughly repaired, when the richly carved roof of the
nave was injudiciously covered with a plaster ceiling.  There are some
ancient monuments, and a tablet to the memory of one William Wakely with
an inscription, stating that he died in 1714, having lived in the reigns
of eight kings and queens.  The living of Shiffnall is a vicarage, in the
presentation of the Rev. John Brooke.  There are places of worship for
Baptists, Independents, and Wesleyan Methodists, and at Priors-Lee is a
chapel of ease under Shiffnall.  The free school here was originally
founded by John Aaron, in 1595, since which period it has been benefitted
by subscriptions, and it is now conducted upon the national plan:
attached to this school are three exhibitions to Christ Church College,
Oxford, founded in 1689, by Edward Careswell—but the benefit of them is
enjoyed by a private classical school, the master of which is nominally
classical master of the free school.  Six poor girls are clothed and
instructed in reading and sewing, by a means of a small endowment
bequeathed by Beatrice Jobber, and there are some minor bequests for the
benefit of the poor.  A savings’ bank some time established, is well
supported.  Shiffnall, the centre of an Union, under the new poor law, of
fifteen parishes, and for the purposes of the union the old workhouse has
been considerably enlarged and otherwise improved.  The market is held on
Tuesday, and the fairs on the first Monday in April, August 5th, and
November 22nd, for horses, sheep, and horned cattle.  A market (not
chartered) is held at Oakengale, every Saturday, which is well attended.
The parish of Shiffnall comprises the townships of HATTON and WOODSIDE,
and the chapelry of PRIORS-LEE with OAKENGALE (or _Oakengates_), these,
with the town of Shiffnall, contained together in 1841, 5,244
inhabitants, and in 1851, 5,616—of which last number, 1,957 were returned
for the town.

Four miles from Shiffnall, and the like distance from Wellington, is
PAIN’S LANE (commonly called _Donington Wood_), in the parish of
LILLESHALL, a district abounding with mines of iron and coal, which
furnish employment to a considerable population.  A district church (or
chapel of ease), together with a national school, have been erected here.
The parish church of Lilleshall is dedicated to Saint Michael, the living
is a discharged vicarage in the gift of the Marquess of Stafford.  The
population is returned with the parish.

SHREWSBURY,
WITH THE VILLAGE OF PONTESBURY AND NEIGHBOURHOODS.


SHREWSBURY is a market town and ancient borough, both corporate and
parliamentary, having separate jurisdiction, locally in the liberties to
which it gives name; 153 miles N.W. from London, 40 S. from Chester, the
like distance W. from Lichfield, 44 W.N.W. from Birmingham, 48 N.N.W.
from Worcester, 53 N. from Hereford, 58 S. from Liverpool, 70 S. by W.
from Manchester, 109 N. from Bristol. 76 N.E. from Aberystwith, and 108
S.E. from Holyhead.  The town is pleasantly seated on two eminences,
rising gently from the Severn, which river, by its windings, forms a
peninsula.  Although no doubt can be entertained of the great antiquity
of Shrewsbury, it being frequently mentioned by our earliest historians,
there is no authentic record of its origin.  Conjecture, however, has
assigned that event to the fifth century, when the Britons were forced by
the Saxons to abandon all the country to the eastward of the river
Severn; and this proposition is well supported from its name, which is,
apparently, of Saxon derivation.  In that language it is called
_Scrobbesbyrig_, or _Scrobbesbyri_; and in the ancient British tongue
_Pengwern_; all signifying ‘the head of the alder groves.’  Shrewsbury
being esteemed the most important town and fortress on the marches of
Wales, continued during several centuries to be one of the principal
places of rendezvous for the English armies,—and hence it was often
visited by royalty.  Through the eventful period which marked the
contentions of the houses of York and Lancaster, as well as when the
parliamentary war broke out, this town and neighbourhood were the scenes
of sieges and conflicts.  In Cromwell’s life-time, and also immediately
after his death, two attempts were made to gain possession of Shrewsbury,
in favour of Charles II, but both of them were frustrated.  The last
circumstance which history records, worthy of notice, occurred in August,
1687, when James II held his court here: on this occasion the sentiments
of loyal attachment, for which Shrewsbury has ever been conspicuous,
burst forth enthusiastically.  Shrewsbury, from its lofty and peninsular
situation, presents, at every approach, a pleasing variety of views; and
the noble sweep of the river, at every turn, enhances the charms of the
prospect.  The exterior circle of the town is lined with an unbroken
range of well built houses, most of which command beautiful views over
the adjacent country.  On its western side, a public walk, designated the
‘Quarry,’ occupies about twenty acres of ground, and is adorned with
avenues of trees.  At one extremity of this delightful promenade are the
remains of a rural amphitheatre, where the Augustine friars of the
adjoining convent were probably wont to exhibit those ancient and sacred
dramas called ‘mysteries,’ or ‘Whitsun plays,’ which were acted here in
the reign of Elizabeth.  The neighbourhood of Shrewsbury is highly
respectable, and the country beautifully picturesque, studded with
numerous gentlemen’s seats and for fertility is not surpassed by any
district in England.

There are several public buildings in Shrewsbury elegant and ornamental.
Amongst the most ancient, as well as interesting, is the castle, founded
by Roger de Montgomery.  It stands on a narrow neck of land, and has been
so greatly altered by modern hands, that it is difficult to form any
probable idea of its primitive state.  The portions of it now remaining
consist of the keep, the mount, the walls of the inner court, and the
great arch of the interior gateway.  The castle is at present the
property of the Duke of Cleveland.  The town-hall was finished in 1786;
but, owing to a defect in the foundation, was taken down, and a new one
subsequently erected: in it are held all meetings of the corporation and
grand juries—likewise the courts of justice for the town and county.  The
town and county gaol and bridewell, which now form one building, stands
near the castle; its situation is at once beautiful and salubrious.  The
market-house is one of the largest and most magnificent buildings of its
kind in England; adjoining which, and in other parts of the town, are
conduits, which supply the inhabitants with excellent spring water.  A
cheese and butter market has been erected in Circus-place, near the Welch
bridge; and a new cattle market, on a grand scale, is formed in the
neighbourhood of Raven-road.  The old theatre was part of the palace
formerly belonging to one of the princes of Powis; it was taken down in
1833, and a very handsome one erected in its place, the basement of which
forms a row of good shops: a new circus has also been added to the
buildings for amusement.

There are two bridges over the Severn, one called the Welch bridge and
the other the English bridge, the former was built in 1790, and the
latter in 1774.  The noble column in honour of General Lord Hill was
completed on the 18th of June, 1816, the anniversary of the battle of
Waterloo.  The height of the pedestal is 13 feet 6 inches; the shaft and
capital, 91 feet 6 inches; the pedestal for the figure, 11 feet 6 inches;
the colossal statue of his lordship, 17 feet; the extreme height, 133
feet 6 inches: the total expense, including the cottage, amounted to
£5,973. 13_s._ 2_d._  The new public building in the Corn-market is an
elegant structure; it comprises the post office, stamp office, a billiard
room, and an exceedingly handsome news room.  Public baths, replete with
every convenience for hot and cold bathing, have been erected at
Cotton-hill: near which are the water-works, which supply the town with
water from the river.  Races are held the second week in May, and are
well attended.  The course, situated within a few minutes’ walk from the
centre of the town, may, in most points, compete with any of the
secondary courses in the kingdom; and the grand stand is a commodious and
handsome building.  Three newspapers are issued from the press here,
weekly—their titles, days of publishing, &c. will be found under their
proper head.

The manufactures of Shrewsbury are neither prominent nor extensive.  At
one period, its trade with the Welch, in flannel, was considerable; but,
from causes variously assigned, it has nearly fallen to decay, and is not
likely to be recovered.  There are three iron and brass foundries, at one
of which the Menai bridge, and other similar works were constructed.  The
malting business is carried on here extensively; and there are five
breweries, two tanneries, and the same number of roperies.  The ancient
art of staining glass has been brought to perfection in this town; and it
has long been famous for that delicate article of pastry—Shrewsbury cake:
the brawn, also, made here, is in high repute; but the chief support of
the place is the custom of the country people, who resort to it, for many
miles round, for the purchase of their various domestic necessaries.
Shrewsbury possesses valuable facilities for commerce and travelling: the
communication by rail with London and Liverpool is effected by means of
the Shrewsbury and Birmingham and the Shrewsbury and Chester railways;
there is also direct intercourse opened with Staffordshire and the
Potteries, by the Shrewsbury and Stafford branch of the Shropshire Union
railway.  There is also a line of railway from Shrewsbury to Hereford,
and other lines are in the course of formation, which, with those already
opened, will render Shrewsbury in a few years, important as the focus of
numerous lines of communication in nearly every direction.  The river,
also affords a convenient transit, for goods of every description to
Worcester, Gloucester, Bristol, and other towns; and the Shrewsbury canal
is the grand medium for supplying the town with coal of an excellent
quality.  The principal Inns of Shrewsbury (of which there are eleven)
are establishments of the most respectable grade, and furnish the best
accommodation, whether for families or commercial gentlemen; while others
are efficient posting-houses—and all are conducted under the best
arrangements.

Shrewsbury was a borough by prescription previous to being incorporated
by Charles I—this charter remained in force until superseded by the
Municipal Act passed in 1835, which vested the government in a mayor, ten
aldermen, and thirty councillors, assisted by a recorder and other
officers: the same enactment divided the borough into five wards, and
provided it with a commission of the peace.  General quarter sessions are
regularly held, of which the recorder is chairman; and the mayor, with
some of the aldermen (who are magistrates), hold a court every Tuesday.
Shrewsbury is included in the twenty-seventh circuit of County Court
towns, under the acts for the recovery of debts not exceeding £50—the
court is held in the Shire hall, once a month.  This borough has
exercised the elective franchise since the 23rd year of Edward I, and has
regularly sent two members.  The mayor is the returning officer; and the
representatives returned at the general election in 1852, were Edward
Holmes Baldock, Esq. 31, Grosvenor place, London, and George Tomfine,
Esq. Great Grimsby, Lincolnshire, and Orwell Park, Ipswich, Suffolk.
From this borough the return is made of members to represent North Salop.

There are no fewer than nine places of worship under the establishment;
they are comprised in the five following parishes, viz. Saint Chad’s and
Saint Alkmund’s, vicarages, in the gift of the Crown; Saint Mary’s, a
royal peculiar; Saint Julian’s, a perpetual curacy, in the presentation
of Lord Tankerville, and Holy Cross and Saint Giles’, a vicarage, in the
patronage of Lord Berwick.  The church of Saint Chad is a very handsome
modern edifice, although on rather a novel pan—the body forming a circle
one hundred feet in diameter.  Saint Mary’s is one of the most
interesting ecclesiastical buildings in the county; it is cruciform in
plan, and exhibits specimens of almost every style of ancient
architecture.  Saint Alkmund’s is a modern gothic erection, with the
exception of the tower and spire, which are of elegant proportions.
Saint Julian’s, rebuilt in 1750, a substantial brick structure, with a
lofty pinnacled tower.  Holy Cross is the church of the abbey, a must
venerable building.  The ancient church of Saint Giles has recently been
restored, by the munificence of the Rev. Richard Scott.  Saint Michael’s,
a chapel of ease to Saint Mary’s parish, is of Grecian design, erected in
1830.  Saint George’s, a chapel of ease to Saint Chad’s, erected in 1832,
is cruciform, in the lancet or early English style.  Trinity chapel
likewise belongs to Saint George’s parish.  The pleasing and appropriate
decorations of the sacred edifices in Shrewsbury excite the attention of
every stranger.  In the abbey garden is a curious stone pulpit, or
oratory.  There are places of worship for various religious
denominations, of which a list is appended to the directory of the town,
as well as of the various institutions, charitable or otherwise.  One of
the principal ornaments of Shrewsbury is the Royal Free School of Edward
VI, erected in 1633, and in which upwards of three hundred pupils, from
all parts of the kingdom, are prepared for the university; the present
head master is the Rev. B. H. Kennedy, D.D.: the annual income of this
establishment is about £3,000.; and belonging to it are numerous
exhibitions to the universities.  The Bishop of Lichfield and Coventry is
visitor, and there are thirteen trustees—the mayor of Shrewsbury, who
presides at the several meetings being one.  There are other endowed
schools of minor importance; a British day school, and another wherein
children are instructed on Dr. Bell’s system and annually clothed.  The
charitable institutions are many—they comprise a small hospital, formerly
dedicated to Saint Giles; another, called Millington’s hospital; several
almshouses, an infirmary, a house of industry. charity schools, and many
private societies for the relief of the sick and poor.  The infirmary is
one of the oldest provincial hospitals in the kingdom; it was first
opened for the admission of patients in 1747.  The original building was
taken down and a handsome new one erected by subscription, in 1830, at an
expense of nearly £20,000.  The building which is of freestone, is of a
plain Grecian character; its entire length is one hundred and seventy
feet, breadth sixty feet, and its height eighty feet: the principal
entrance is by means of a Doric portico in the centre.  It is adapted for
one hundred and fifty beds.  The number of in-patients admitted annually
is about 1020; and of out-patients 3700.  There is an extensive and very
valuable medical library belonging to the infirmary.

The principal market is on Saturday, but there is another on Wednesday;
and every second Wednesday in the month a fair (or large market) is held,
which is numerously attended, when the produce of the rich and fertile
country around is disposed of.  For the purposes of the monthly market,
there is a spacious and convenient hall in Howard-street.  The borough,
town and liberties of Shrewsbury, contained, by the census of 1841,
21,525 inhabitants, and in 1851, the population of the borough and
liberties was 23,104; of which last number 19,681 belonged to the
borough.

PONTESBURY, a parish in the hundred of Ford, is divided into the four
quarters of Cruckton, Edge, Longdon and Pontesbury.  In the last named
quarter is the parish church of Saint George, once collegiate and rebuilt
a few years ago: it is situated about 7 miles S.S.W. from Shrewsbury.  In
this parish are lead mines, worked to considerable profit.  The parish
contained, in 1841, 3,311 inhabitants, and in 1851, 3,363.

WELLINGTON,
WITH THE VILLAGES OF WROCKWARDINE, WOMBRIDGE, KETLEY AND NEIGHBOURHOODS.


WELLINGTON is a market town and parish in the hundred of Bradford, 144
miles N.W. from London, and 11 E. from Shrewsbury.  The town is situated
near the ancient Roman _Watling Street_, about two miles from the Wrekin,
a lofty mountain, which rises from the plain to the height of 1,200 feet
above the bed of the Severn.  The face of the country around here, is
diversified by mountainous tracts of land, and rich valleys; while
another wide portion is an even surface, fertile, and in a perfect state
of agriculture.  During the great civil war, this was the first place of
rendezvous of Charles I.  On the 19th September, 1642, the king mastered
his forces near the town, and having commanded his military orders to be
read, delivered, in person, the remarkable address mentioned by
Clarendon.  Wellington-under-the-Wrekin, as it is sometimes called, to
distinguish it from Wellington in Somersetshire, is neatly built,
contains a number of good houses, is gas-lighted, and has received
considerable improvements; among these may be mentioned the erection of a
new and handsome church, and a neat market-hall.

The government of the town is vested in a mayor and constables, and two
clerks are appointed to regulate the markets: these officers are
nominated at the manorial court, held annually in November by Lord
Forester the lord of the manor.  The magistrates sit in petty sessions
weekly, upon business connected with the hundred; and a County Court is
held monthly in Church-street, for the recovery of debts not exceeding
£50—the town being included in the twenty-seventh circuit of towns.
Wellington is a polling station at the election of members to represent
the northern division of the county.  The trade of this place is of some
consequence—seated at it is, in the centre of a productive coal and lime
district; besides which, the many works are of considerable magnitude;
there are many malting and flour mills, and the trade in hops, seeds and
timber, is somewhat extensive.  The town contains several excellent
inns—the principal are the ‘Bull’s Head,’ in New-street, and the
‘Charlton Arms,’ in Church-street.  We notice the ‘Admaston Hotel’ under
Wrockwardine village.  Wellington is now included in the advantages
derived from the rail—the Shrewsbury and Birmingham line intersects the
town, and the Wellington and Stafford branch of the Shropshire Union
Railways communicates therewith; a station erected in the centre of the
town, is used in common by both lines.

The parish church of All Saints, is a light and modern edifice of
freestone; a portion of it is supported by iron pillars, and the same
material is employed in the window frames, thereby imparting a light
appearance to the whole: the living is a vicarage, with the rectory of
Eyton on the Wild Moors annexed, in the patronage of Thomas Eyton, Esq.;
the present incumbent is the Rev. Benjamin Banning.  There are places of
worship for Baptists, Independents, Wesleyan and Primitive Methodists,
and Roman Catholics.  The principal charities are a free school for
teaching poor children of both sexes; another conducted upon the national
plan; an almshouse for six poor women; a dispensary, recently
established, and a new and commodious Union Workhouse—the latter, for the
reception of the poor of eleven parishes, of which Wellington is the
centre.  Amusement and instruction are derived from a concert-hall,
billiard and news-rooms, and a mechanics’ institute; all of which are of
recent establishment.  A mile from the town is Apley Castle, the seat of
St. John S. Charlton, Esq.; and about the like distance westward, is
Orleton Hall, the residence of the Hon. R. C. Herbert.  The market is
held on Thursday; the fairs March 29th, June 22nd, September 29th and
November 17th.  The fairs and markets are well attended; at the September
fair a great weight of butter and cheese is disposed of; the others are
chiefly for horses, cattle, sheep and pigs.  Fairs (or cattle markets)
are likewise held on the last Tuesday in the months of January, February,
April, May, July, August, October, and December.  The parish contained,
in 1841, 10,990, and in 1851, 11,554 inhabitants.

Two miles W. by N. from Wellington, is the village of WROCKWARDINE, the
parish of which embraces a large coal and iron district.  Within the
parish at ADMASTON, about a mile from Wrockwardine, are two valuable
springs—one chalybeate, the other sulphureous.  An admirably conducted
hotel and boarding house, with hot and cold baths, have been erected here
at a considerable expense; and the waters being found beneficial in cases
of rheumatism, it is resorted to by many afflicted with that complaint,
and other visitors.  The Shrewsbury Canal passes through the parish, and
the river Tern washes its northern border.  The parish church of Saint
Peter, is a venerable structure of red stone, substantially built: the
benefice is a discharged vicarage, in the gift of the Crown; the Rev.
George Lavington Yate is the present incumbent.  There has been erected a
handsome district church, or chapel of ease.  The parish contained, by
the returns for 1841, 2,731 inhabitants, and by those for 1851, 3,107.

WOMBRIDGE is a parish, in the same division as Wellington—the village
being about three miles east from that town.  The Shrewsbury, Shropshire
and Marquess of Stafford’s Canals forms a junction in this parish, which
is intersected by the _Watling Street_ of the Romans, and the main road
to Holyhead—also by several tram-roads from the coal and iron works at
Ketley, &c.  The parish church is dedicated to Saint Leonard: the living
is a perpetual curacy, in the presentation of the family of Charlton.
The parish contained, in 1841, 2,057, and in 1851, 2,166 inhabitants.

WEM,
WITH THE VILLAGES OF PREES, EDSTASTON, LOPPINGTON AND NEIGHBOURHOODS.


WEM is a parish, partly in the Whitchurch division of the hundred of
Bradford, and extending into the hundred of Pimhill—the market town is
164 miles N.W. from London, 10 N. from Shrewsbury, and the like distance
S. from Whitchurch; pleasantly situated on the road leading to the two
last named towns, and near to the source of the Roden.  Wem was the first
town in the county which declared for the parliament in 1643: in that
year a party of the king’s troops attempted to capture it by storm, but
were repulsed by the small garrison, assisted, it is affirmed, by the
zealous exertions of the women; and at a subsequent period, under the
government of Major General Mytton, the garrison plundered the houses and
possessions of the neighbouring royalists—and the booty conveyed by them
into the town was the means of its flourishing more than at any
antecedent period.  Many of the houses are ancient structures, the more
modern ones having been erected after the destructive fire in 1677, which
consumed the church, market house, and whole ranges of buildings,
destroying property to the amount of £23,000.  The unprincipled Judge
Jeffreys became possessed of this place about the year 1685, and was
created Baron Wem, being the first who enjoyed that dignity by patent,
but at the death of his son the title became extinct.  This place is not
distinguished by manufactories or any peculiar branch of trade—there are
two tan-yards, several maltings and two or three corn mills in the
vicinity, that belonging to Thomas Jebb, junr. is a large and powerful
one driven by steam: the business here generally, however, is dependent
on supplying the inhabitants, and those of the immediate neighbourhood
(which is very respectable), with articles of ordinary consumption.  The
streets are well lighted with gas, and there are many good shops and
several respectable private residences in New street.  An act of
parliament has been obtained for a branch from the London and North
Western Railway from Shrewsbury to Crewe, which will pass through this
town.  The principal officers are two bailiffs, appointed annually at a
court leet, held soon after Michaelmas—one by the manorial lord’s
steward, and the other by the borough jury.  Wem is included in the
twenty seventh circuit of County Court towns, under the acts passed for
the recovery of debts to any amount not exceeding £50.—the court is held
monthly.

The parish church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, is a handsome edifice,
with a lofty tower and fine chancel: nearly three hundred additional
sittings were obtained by building two new galleries in 1840, which are
free from a grant from the Society for building churches; the living is a
rectory, in the gift of Lord Darlington: the present rector is the Rev.
J. W. D. Merist.  There are places of worship for Baptists, Independents,
Methodists, and Irvingites.  The free school, here, was founded and
liberally endowed, in 1653, by Sir Thomas Adams, a native of this town;
it has two exhibitions to the universities, founded by Mr. Careswell.
The British school, in Dark-lane, was established in 1839, partly by a
government grant and partly by subscriptions; it is for children of both
sexes.  The national school is situated in Noble-street, and was erected
at an expense of nearly £1,000.  Situate a mile S.W. from Wem, is a
mineral spring.  The market is held on Thursday; and the fairs on the
first Thursday in March, May 6th, Holy Thursday, first Thursday in June,
June 29th, first Thursday in August, the last Thursday in September, and
November 21st.  The parish of Wem, which comprises ten townships and two
chapelries, contained in 1841, 4,119 inhabitants, and in 1851, 3,747.

PREES is a parish, in the Whitchurch division of the hundred of
Bradford—the village is between four and five miles N.N.E. from Wem.
There are several maltings here, and a traffic in lime, coal and slate,
is carried on by means of the Quinabrook canal, which passes through the
parish—taken altogether, however, the trade of the place is but
inconsiderable.  The parish church of Saint Mary, is an ancient cruciform
structure, with a tower of much later date; in the church are some
specimens of tesselated pavement, and several monuments to the ancestors
of General Lord Hill, who was born herein 1772: the living is a vicarage,
in the peculiar jurisdiction of the prebendary of Prees, in Lichfield
Cathedral; the present incumbent is the Rev. Archdeacon Allen.  Prees had
formerly a market, which has long been discontinued; but two fairs are
still maintained—on the second Mondays in April and October.  The parish
of Prees contained, in 1831, 3,335 inhabitants, in 1841, 3,270, and in
1851, 3,196; of which last number, 630 belonged to the village.

EDSTASTON is a chapelry, in the parish of Wem, about 2 miles N. from that
town, seated on the road to Whitchurch.  A branch of the Ellesmere canal
passes through the village, and terminates at Quinabrook.  It contains a
chapel of ease, a very ancient structure, and about 400 inhabitants.

LOPPINGTON is a parish and village pleasantly situated about 3 miles S.W.
from Wem.  The church of Saint Michael is a plain ancient structure.  The
population of the parish in 1851, was 599.

WENLOCK.


OR MUCH WENLOCK, is an ancient borough, both corporate and parliamentary,
a market town and parish, and the head of a liberty, having separate
jurisdiction; 148 miles N.W. from London, and 12 S.E. from Shrewsbury.
The town, which is situated on the Phobrook, and in a pleasant vale, is
of considerable antiquity.  The British name was _Llan Melien_, or ‘Saint
Milburgh’s Church;’ and in the Monasticon it is denominated _Winnica_, or
‘the windy place.’  Its early importance originated with the
establishment of a convent, about 680, by Melburga, daughter of king
Merwald.  Having been destroyed by the Danes, it was restored by the Earl
of Mercia, after which it fell into decay.  Soon after the Conquest it
was rebuilt by Roger de Montgomery, and converted into a priory for
Cluniac monks.  The ruins are on the south side of the town; they are
extensive, and present the most finished specimens of Norman
architecture, together with the early and decorated English styles.  Of
the church, the south transept is in the most perfect state, three
beautiful Norman arches, and two of the cloisters remain in good
preservation.  This establishment must have been extensive, and its
buildings magnificent.  The town consists principally of two narrow
streets, some of the houses forming which are modern and respectable in
appearance, and others but poorly built.  The guildhall, more remarkable
for its antiquity than its external beauty, is constructed of timber
frame-work, resting on piazzas.  This building underwent in 1849,
restoration with great taste and skill, at the expense of the
corporation.  Two charters have been granted to this ancient borough; the
first in the eighth of Edward IV, at the request of Sir John Wenlock,
Knight, ‘in consideration of laudable and acceptable services performed
by the liege men of the town of Wenlock.’  The second charter was granted
in the reign of Charles I.  Under the Municipal Reform Act, the corporate
body consists of a mayor, two aldermen and six councillors.  The borough
is divided into three wards—namely, Wenlock Ward, Broseley Ward, and
Madeley Ward.  Sessions are held quarterly in the guildhall, before the
recorder, and the magistrates meet here in petty sessions every sixth
Tuesday.  The Madeley circuit of the new County Court, includes Wenlock
in its jurisdiction; the court sits monthly at the former town, and takes
cognizance of debts and claims to any amount not exceeding £50.  Sir
Watkin Williams Wynn, Bart., is lord of the manor, and holds, by his
agent, courts leet and baron, in the months of May and October.  The
elective franchise was conferred upon the burgesses by Edward IV, with
the privilege of returning one member—the borough now sends two; those
returned at the general election in 1852, were the Honble. George Cecil
Weld Forester, Willey Park, Salop; and James Milnes Gaskell, Esq. Thornes
House, Wakefield, Yorkshire (both re-elected).  The Boundary Act defines
the limits of the borough to comprise ‘the old borough of Wenlock:’ by
the same act the town is appointed a polling station at the election of
members to represent North Salop.  In the time of Richard II, this place
was noted for copper mines, and lime quarries: the former have ceased to
be wrought, but the latter are still productive, and in the town are two
maltings and a tannery.

The places of worship are the parish church of the Holy Trinity, and a
chapel for Wesleyan Methodists.  The former is a venerable structure,
with a square tower surmounted by a spire; it partakes, in a remote
degree, of the style of the abbey, being partly of the Norman and partly
of the decorated English: the living is a discharged vicarage, with the
perpetual curacies of Burton and Benthall annexed, in the gift of the
lord of the manor; the Rev. William Henry Wayne, is the present
incumbent, and the Rev. Nathaniel Haywood, curate.  The principal
charities consist of a free school, originally endowed in 1778, by the
Rev. Francis Southern; and almshouses for four poor widows.  There is a
reading room in connection with a well-selected library, to which, also
is attached, a museum, formed to illustrate the natural history and
antiquities of Wenlock and its neighbourhood.  The market is held on
Monday; and the fairs, on the second Monday in March, and May 12th, for
horned cattle, horses and sheep, and for hiring servants; July 5th, for
sheep and October 17th, and December 4th, for cattle of all kinds.  The
parish of Much Wenlock contained, by the government returns for 1841,
2,487 inhabitants, and in 1851, 2,398.

POST OFFICE, Wilmore-street, Thomas Lawley, _Post Master_.—Letters from
LONDON and all parts arrive (from WELLINGTON), every morning at
twenty-eight minutes before seven, and are despatched thereto at seven in

WHITCHURCH,
WITH DODINGTON, TILSTOCK AND NEIGHBOURHOODS.


WHITCHURCH is a parish, chiefly in the hundred of Bradford (North), and
extending into that of Nantwich, in the county of Chester—the town is 161
miles N.W. by N. from London, situated on the main road between
Shrewsbury and Chester, 20 miles from each of the latter places: it is
seated on elevated ground, in a rich and picturesque country; and
contains some neat streets and respectable dwellings.  An intended
railway from Crewe to Shrewsbury will include Whitchurch in its route.
The town was anciently called _Album Monasterium_ and _Blancminster_,
which have the same meaning (Whitechurch) and appear to imply the seat of
a monastery, of which there are no remains; but a hospital was standing
here in the reign of Henry III. and was endowed by the lord of the manor
with the whole town of Wilnecot, for the relief of the poor at its gate.
Of the foundation and history of the ancient castle—fragments of which
were visible in 1760, nothing is known.  At the commencement of the civil
war between Charles and his parliament, the inhabitants of Whitchurch
declared in favour of the monarch, and promptly raised a regiment in
support of his cause.  An iron and brass foundry, a good brewery, and
several roperies, are on a respectable scale, but malting may be
considered the principal, if not the staple branch.  The Ellesmere canal
comes close to the centre of the town, and in its vicinity are several
brooks—one of which, called Red Brook, is the boundary between England
and Wales, and another separates this county from Cheshire.  A high
steward who superintends the affairs of the town, is appointed by the
lord of the manor (Earl of Brownlow), and presides at courts baron and
leet, held in October, in the town hall, which is the depository for the
rolls and archives of the lordship.  Whitchurch is included in the
twenty-seventh circuit of County Court towns under the acts for the
recovery of debts not exceeding £50. and it is a polling station at the
election of members to represent North Salop.

That which principally engages the notice of a traveller, in this town,
is its fine church of Saint Mary (or as some assert Saint Alkmund)—a
noble structure of the Tuscan order, erected in 1722 on the spot where an
old Gothic one formerly stood.  The whole edifice is built of fine
freestone; and at the west end is a stately square tower, in which are
eight good bells.  The entire building is very regular, consisting of a
large nave, with side aisles, and contains several ancient monuments;
among these is one to the memory of the great John Talbot, the first Earl
of Shrewsbury, who was called the English Achilles, and so renowned in
France, that no man in that kingdom dared to encounter him single-handed.
Another effigy represents Christopher Talbot, fourth son of John Talbot,
second Earl of Shrewsbury, who was rector of Whitchurch and archdeacon of
Chester.  The living—one of the richest in the county, is in the
presentation of the lord of the manor.  The present rector is the Rev.
William Henry Egerton, M.A.  The other places of worship are for
Baptists, Independents, and Methodists.  The free grammar school here was
founded in the reign of Edward VI. by Sir John Talbot, rector of this
parish, aided by contributions of the inhabitants.  It has been lately
rebuilt, in the Elizabethan style, and is now a handsome structure.  A
large national school for boys, and another for girls; a British school;
an almshouse for its decayed housekeepers, and the union workhouse,
situated at Derr Moss, are the other principal charities.  The country
round here is fertile, and in an excellent state of agriculture.  The
views, especially towards the Welch and Derby hills, are very fine; and
the nearer prospect is enriched with two lakes, called Blake-mere and
Horse-mere.  The market is held on Friday; and the fairs on the second
Friday in April, Whit-Monday, and the first Friday after the 2nd of
August, October 28th, and December 1st, for sheep, cattle, &c.  The
parish of Whitchurch (not including the township of Wirsall, county of
Chester), contained in 1841, 6,285 inhabitants, and in 1851, 5,977.

The township of DODINGTON adjoins Whitchurch, and its population is
returned therewith.  It has a chapel of ease to Whitchurch and a very
handsome one for Independents.

TILSTOCK, a chapelry to Whitchurch, is between two and three miles from
that town.  It contains a neat chapel of ease, erected in 1834, one for
Wesleyan Methodists, and a national school.  Population returned with the
parish.
