    Dear Boys and Girls.—

    In the short time I have been among you, I have made
    friends of some of the best little boys and girls
    throughout the land.

    I have been writing to my brothers and sisters at home
    telling them all about you, and they are very anxious
    to become acquainted also; so I sent for our family
    photograph album, which contains most of their pictures.

    Now Old Mother Goose is a neighbor of ours, and she
    earns her living by writing little rhymes, tales and
    jingles, and as she is a very good friend of our
    family, she has written many verses and rhymes about
    us, which I know you will enjoy reading.

    So you see I take great pride in presenting you this
    copy of our Family Photograph Album.

                             Your sincere friend,
                                             Teddy.

[Illustration]

    What are little Ted boys made of, made of?
    What are little Ted boys made of?
    Snaps and snails, and puppy-dogs’ tails;
    And that’s what Little Ted Boys are made of, made of.

[Illustration]

    What are little Ted girls made of, made of?
    What are little Ted girls made of?
    Sugar and spice, and all that’s nice;
    And that’s what Little Ted girls are made of, made of.

[Illustration]

    Ding dong bell!
      Teddy’s in the well!
      Who put him in?
      Little Teddy Flinn.
      Who pulled him out?
      Little Teddy Stout.
    What a naughty boy was there
    Thus to drown poor Teddy Bear.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

      Little Ted Horner
      Sat in a corner,
    Eating a Christmas Pie.
      He put in his thumb,
    And took out a plum,
      And said, “What a big bear am I!”

[Illustration]

[Illustration: To Bonner]

    As I went to Bonner,
        I met a bear
      With coal-black hair,
    Upon my word and honor.

[Illustration: Old Mother Hubbard]

    Old Mother Hubbard
      Went to the cupboard
        To get Little Teddy a bun;
    But when she got there,
    The cupboard was bare,
        So poor Little Ted had none.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    She went to the baker’s
      To buy him some bread;
    But when she came back,
      Poor Teddy was dead.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    She went to the joiner’s
      To buy him a coffin;
    But when she came back,
      Little Teddy was laughing

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    She took a clean dish
      To get him some tripe;
    But when she came back,
      He was smoking his pipe

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    She went to the tavern
      For white wine and red;
    But when she came back,
      Ted stood on his head.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    She went to the ale-house
      To get him some beer;
    But when she came back,
      Ted sat in a chair.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    She went to the barber’s
      To buy him a wig;
    But when she came back,
      He was dancing a Jig

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    She went to the fruiterer’s
      To buy him some fruit;
    But when she came back,
      Ted was playing the flute.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    She went to the cobbler’s
      To buy him some shoes;
    But when she came back,
      Ted was reading the news.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Dame Bear made a curtsey,
      Little Ted made a bow;
    Dame Bear said, “Your servant,”
      Little Ted said, “How now.”

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Rain, rain, go away;
    Come again another day;
    Little Teddy wants to play.

    Solomon Grundy
    Born on a Monday,
    Christened on Tuesday,
    Married on Wednesday,
    Very ill on Thursday,
    Worse on Friday,
    Died on Saturday,
    Buried on Sunday,
    This is the end,
    Of Solomon Grundy.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

      Ted and Jill
    Went up the hill,
    To fetch a pail
        of water;

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

      Ted Fell down,
    And broke his crown,
    And Jill came
      Tumbling after.

[Illustration]

    To make your candles last for aye,
    You wives and maids give ear-o!
    To put them out’s the only way,
    Says Honest Ted Boldero.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Little Teddy Tittlemouse
    Lived in a little house;
    He caught fishes
    In other men’s ditches.

[Illustration]

    Multiplication is vexation;
    2 x 2 = ?
    Division is as bad;
    6 ÷ 2  = ?
    The rule of three perplexes me,
    3 x 3 = ?
    And practice drives me mad.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Teddy Trot, a man of law
    Sold his bed and lay upon straw
    Sold the straw and slept on grass
    To buy his wife a looking-glass

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Wash me and comb me,
    And lay me down softly,
    And set me on a bank to dry;
    That I may look pretty
    When Teddy comes by.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Tell-Tale Tit!
    Your tongue shall be slit,
    And all the Teddy Bears in town
    Shall have a little bit!

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Nose, nose, jolly red nose,
      And what gave you that jolly red nose?
      Nutmegs and cinnamon spices and cloves,
      And they gave me this jolly red nose.

[Illustration]

    Three wise bears of Gotham
    Went to sea in a bowl;
    If the bowl had been stronger
    My story had been longer.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            Teddy be nimble,
            Teddy be quick,
    And Teddy jump over the candlestick.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    See-saw, Margery Daw,
      Teddy shall have a new master;
    He shall have but a penny a day,
      Because he can’t work any faster

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Little Ted Snooks was Fond of his books,
      And loved by his usher and master;
    But naughty Ted Spry, he got a black eye,
      And carries his nose in a plaster.

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Cock crows in the morn,
      To tell us to rise,
    And he who lies late
      Will never be wise;

    For early to bed,
      And early to rise,
    Makes teddy bears healthy
      And wealthy and wise.

    _The rose is red,
     The grass is green;
     And in this book
     My name is seen._
