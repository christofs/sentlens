MR. PUNCH'S ADVICE TO HOUSEKEEPERS.

[Illustration: "_IF YOU WANT A THING DONE, DO IT YOURSELF._"--No. I.

FOR EXAMPLE:--BY GETTING UP AT DAY-BREAK, CLEANING OUT YOUR STABLE, AND
TAKING THE HORSES OUT FOR EXERCISE, YOU WILL ACCOMPLISH YOUR OBJECT.]

[Illustration: "_IF YOU WANT A THING DONE, DO IT YOURSELF._"--No. II.

AND----ENABLE THE GROOMS TO GET THEIR BREAKFAST COMFORTABLY, AND SO
KEEP THEM IN GOOD HUMOUR FOR THE REST OF THE DAY.]

[Illustration: "_IF YOU WANT A THING DONE, DO IT YOURSELF._"--No. III.

HAVING THOROUGHLY DRESSED AND FED THE HORSES, YOU HAD BETTER SET TO
WORK UPON THE BOOTS OF THE ESTABLISHMENT. THE KNIVES, AS YOU HAVE A
MACHINE, YOU MAY AS WELL DO. AND, WHILE YOUR HANDS ARE SOILED, YOU HAD
BETTER HELP ALPHONSO TO CARRY UP SOME COALS.]

[Illustration: "_IF YOU WANT A THING DONE, DO IT YOURSELF._"--No. IV.

THERE CAN BE NO REASON WHY THE GIRLS SHOULDN'T DRESS THEMSELVES, THAT
PARKER THE MAID MAY GO TO HER DANCING.]

[Illustration: "_IF YOU WANT A THING DONE, DO IT YOURSELF._"--No. V.

AS FOR JOHN THOMAS, THE BEST PLAN, OF COURSE, IS TO WAIT UPON _HIM_,
AND THEN, PERHAPS (ALTHOUGH IT BY NO MEANS FOLLOWS), HE MAY BE
SATISFIED!

    [_As most Domestics are fond of the Organ-grinders, you had better
engage one of an evening for their amusement._

]

[Illustration: "_IF YOU WANT A THING DONE, DO IT YOURSELF._"--No. VI.

IT IS CERTAINLY BETTER TO MIND THE BROUGHAM YOURSELF, ESPECIALLY IN
FOGGY WEATHER, AS, IN CONSEQUENCE OF ROBERT'S UNFORTUNATE PROPENSITY,
YOUR FAMILY ARE ALWAYS MORE OR LESS IN DANGER WHEN RETURNING FROM
THE THEATRE. ]

[Illustration: "_IF YOU WANT A THING DONE, DO IT
YOURSELF._"--No. VII.

NEVER DISTURB THE MAIDS IN THE MORNING, BUT JUMP OUT OF BED THE MOMENT
YOU HEAR THE SWEEP, AND LET HIM IN; IT ISN'T MUCH TROUBLE, AND SAVES A
WORLD OF GRUMBLING.]

[Illustration: _DOMESTIC DOCTORING._
