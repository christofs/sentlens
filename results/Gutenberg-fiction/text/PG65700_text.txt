               Mr. J. A. HARVIE BROWN, Mr. J. CORDEAUX,

                             SIXTH REPORT.

                          (Vol. II., No. 1.)


"A good practical naturalist must be a good observer; and how many
qualities are required to make up a good observer! Attention, patience,
quickness to seize separate facts, discrimination to keep them
unconfused, readiness to combine them, and rapidity and yet slowness of
induction; above all, perfect fidelity, which can be seduced neither
by the enticements of a favourite theory nor by the temptation to see
a little more than actually happens in some passing drama."--_Essays,
Bishop Wilberforce_, Vol. I.

PREFACE.


The following Report contains a summary of investigations of the
Committee re-appointed by the British Association for the Advancement
of Science, at Montreal, Canada, in 1884, to consist of Professor
Newton, Mr. J. A. Harvie Brown, Mr. John Cordeaux, Mr. W. Eagle Clarke,
Mr. R. M. Barrington, and Mr. A. G. More, for the purpose of obtaining
(with the consent of the Master and Elder Brethren of the Trinity
House, the Commissioners of Northern Lights, and the Commissioners of
Irish Lights) observations on the Migration of Birds at Lighthouses
and Lightships, and of reporting on the same at Aberdeen in 1885. Mr.
Cordeaux to be the Secretary.

The returns relating to Scotland have been arranged by Mr. J. A. Harvie
Brown; for the East Coast of England, by Mr. Cordeaux; for the West
Coast of England, by Mr. W. Eagle Clarke; and those for the Coasts of
Ireland, by Mr. R. M. Barrington, Mr. A. G. More, and Mr. Eagle Clarke.

Having obtained an additional grant from the British Association, we
venture this year to add a new feature to our Report in the form of a
sketch-map, showing all the stations in _red_. We have done this at the
intelligent request of several of our reporters; and the map has been
executed for us by Messrs. Macfarlane & Erskine, of St. James' Square,
Edinburgh.

SIXTH REPORT:

ON

THE MIGRATION OF BIRDS

IN THE

SPRING AND AUTUMN OF 1884.




OCEAN NOTES.


Thanks again to Messrs. Gray and Anderson, I have some interesting
items of migration to record, taken by the latter gentleman on board
the steamship 'Marathon' in the Atlantic. These are best given _in
extenso_; and land-notes will be given after the paragraphs on each
species or group.


_Steamship 'Marathon,' outward bound from Liverpool, April 16th, 1884._

April 17th.--A small bird came on board at 7 p.m., 15 miles from
nearest land. (Position of ship at noon, Queenstown). Wind easterly for
ten hours previous, and was increasing to moderate gale from E.N.E.
when the bird was seen. From the description of this bird it can
scarcely have been other than a Whinchat or Stonechat. No Petrels.[1]

[Footnote 1: The lat. and long, give the ship's position at noon each
day.]

April 18th.--At 7 p.m., another, precisely the same species as
yesterday's, 310 miles from land; not caught. Eight Kittiwakes and four
Manx Shearwaters. Wind light E. all day. (Position of ship at noon,
lat. 51° N., long. 15° 47′ W.). No Petrels.

April 19th.--Two Kittiwakes all day, till 580 miles from land. Little
Auks[2] (?) seen frequently in parties of two to eight all day. Two
Shearwaters, 600 miles from land. Lat. 60° 1′, long. 22° W.

[Footnote 2: Called "Little Puffins," size of Water Ouzel, in notes.]

April 20th.--At 8 a.m., one Manx Shearwater, 770 miles out. Several
pairs of little Auks during forenoon. At 5 p.m., two Black-backed
Common Shearwaters, 870 miles from land, outward bound. No Petrels.

April 21st.--At 7 a.m., two Common Shearwaters, 1090 miles from
Fastnet. At 11.30 a.m., two Wilson's Petrels, 1145 miles out. Lat. 46°
37′, long. 36° 18′; calm. (_Note._--Previous to this date the note was
appended to each day's entry, "No Petrels.")

April 22nd.--At 8 a.m., one Wilson's Petrel (_i.e._, _Oceanites
oceanicus_, Kuhl.), 1400 miles out from Fastnet; and one at 4 p.m.,
1500 miles. At 7 p.m., two large Puffins[3] flying south. Wind light E.
Lat. 44° 11′, long. 42° 22′.

[Footnote 3: Common Puffin, "Tammy Norie," _Fratercula arctica_
(Linn.).]

April 23rd.--At 11 a.m., two black-looking birds, like Gulls (? Skuas)
flying rapidly to N.E. During the day saw several specimens of the
large sea-bird usually seen on the banks (of which we are now within
sixty miles). [Probably from description the immature of some species
of large Gull.--J. A. H. B.]. Numerous small parties of two or three of
the Little Auk, and two large Puffins. From 6 to 7 p.m., saw numerous
parties of ten to twelve of some kind of (apparently) Plover, flying
south. No Petrels. Lat. 42° 28′, long. 43° 39′; wind light N.E.

April 24th.--At 7 a.m., three Black-footed Petrels,--Fork-tailed Petrel
(_Thalassidroma leucorrhoa_),--and two Wilson's Petrels. At 5 p.m., one
Little Auk and one Gull (yellow beak and legs), 700 miles from Boston
at noon. Lat. 42° 24′, long. 55° 05′; wind light easterly.

April 25th.--At 8 a.m., six "Shore" Gulls and two Little Auks. At 5
p.m., one Skua. No Petrels. Lat. 42° 24′, long. 61° 21′; calm.

April 26th.--Occasional Gulls all day. No Petrels. Wind light N.; 141
miles from Boston at noon.


_Return Voyage of Steamship 'Marathon' from Boston, May 3rd._

May 3rd.--At 11 a.m., when 220 miles from Boston, one Common
Swallow (by description a Martin.--J. A. H. B.) going west(!). Eight
Black-footed Petrels; one Solan Goose, immature; numerous Gulls. At
6 a.m., apparently the same Solan Goose, twelve Wilson's Petrels,
numerous Gulls, five Puffins, and two Little Auks. Lat. 42° 16′, long.
65° 58′; wind light W.

May 5th.--At 8.30 a.m., one Skua. Thirty to forty Wilson's Petrels all
day. At 6 p.m., a couple of Gulls, and some Puffins. Lat. 42° 10′,
long. 59° 56′; wind light to mod. W.

May 6th.--From 8 a.m. till dark, thirty Wilson's Petrels, two Little
Auks, and one Gull. Lat. 42° 04′, long. 53°; wind mod. N.W.

May 7th.--All day, twenty Wilson's Petrels, and four Manx Shearwaters.
Lat. 42° 56′, long. 46° 46′; wind fresh N.W.

May 8th.--At 8 a.m., one Black-footed Petrel (Fork-tailed Petrel
probably, Wilson's being yellow-webbed between the toes--J. A. H. B.).
Wind strong N.

May 9th.--At 8 a.m., five Terns flying N. At 8.30, twelve Terns
resting on sea ahead, flew north. At 5 p.m., seven or eight Wilson's
Petrels flying north, very tired-looking, and never heeded the ship.
One "Black-footed Petrel" flying N. Lat. 47° 29′, long. 36° 09′; wind
strong N.

May 10th.--Very numerous parties of Terns all day, flying north, three
to twelve in number. At 9 a.m., one Skua, one Black-footed Petrel, and
one Kittiwake. Lat. 49° 12′, long. 30° 04′, or 794 miles from Fastnet;
wind strong to mod. N.

May 11th.--At 8 a.m., several parties of Terns, and three Skuas, all
going north. At 8.30 a.m., one Kittiwake. At 5 p.m., three Kittiwakes.
At 7 p.m., three Skuas circling about. No Petrels. Lat. 50° 81′, long,
23° 19′; wind mod. N.

May 12th.--At 8 a.m., sixteen Kittiwakes, 10 Wilson's Petrels, and
four Manx Shearwaters. At 6 p.m., three Skuas, and two very dark
hawk-looking birds, evidently in company, one very dark and the
other had white vest and throat (Mr. Anderson's "Skuas" are probably
Pomatorhine Skuas, and these last Richardson's Skuas.--J. A. H. B.). At
6.30 a flock of eighty or ninety Terns flying high and going N. and W.,
and circling frequently as if in doubt as to the proper course. They
approached the ship from N.E., and were lost to sight astern, still
undecided. One Puffin.

May 13th.--At 8 a.m., one (by description) Richardson's Skua flew
past, seaward, ten miles from Queenstown, at noon. No Petrels.

May 14th.--Only Gulls and Puffins.

The 'Marathon' is again advertised to sail for Boston on June 18th.


_Cunard Royal Mail Steamship, 'Gallia.'_

At a later date Mr. Anderson sends a note on Solan Geese:--"On Jan.
20th we passed numerous Solan Geese at Cape St. Vincent. They could not
fly, and many had a hard job to flutter off on the surface sufficiently
far to clear the ship. I saw one black one. The others were mostly
white, with yellowish heads and greyish beaks. They all had the
appearance of being fully fledged. One Robin stayed a day on board
between Naples and Burriana, in Spain."

We suspect the regular appearance of Solans so far to the southward
will turn out to be closely associated with the migrations of fish,
possibly pilchards; and that, gorged with these fish, they were unable
to rise off the water, this difficulty not arising from any state of
moult in the bird's plumage.--J. A. H. B.


_Union Steamship 'Athenian.'--First Voyage, 1884._

Thanks also to Mr. Spearman Swinburne, of Union Steamship 'Athenian,' I
have several good schedules returned from two voyages--one in spring,
between April 5th and 29th; and the second between Aug. 24th and Oct.
4th.

April 5th.--One Robin, one Yellowhammer, a flock of Jackdaws, three
Lapwings, and one Crested Lark (_A. cristata_), between 7 a.m. and
2 p.m.; strong S.S.E.; v. c. r. The Robin alighted, so did the
Yellowhammer. The Jackdaws were flying to eastward. The Lapwings
followed the ship, and the Crested Lark alighted on board. The Robin
and Yellowhammer were seen in lat. 53° N., long. 9° E.; the others in
lat. 54° N., long. 10° E.

April 12th.--Seven Red-throated Divers, flying E.; one lot of three,
the rest singly, all with white throats; 6 to 7 a.m.; light N.W.,
clear; off Schelling light-vessel.

April 20th.--One Wheatear, 2 p.m. till dark; light N.E., v. c.;
alighted on board. Lat. 46° N., long. 8° W.

April 22nd.--Bulwer's Petrels, throughout the morning; W., strong,
v. c.; about nine or ten in all flying singly, generally against the
wind. Lat. 34° N., long. 16° W. Also one "white-breasted" Petrel, at 7
a.m., same lat. and long., fluttering on surface. One Black Tern (in
full black plumage); and on April 29th, Sooty Terns and Common Terns;
a large flock at 9 a.m., wind light S., including with these species a
dark species of Gull.[4] Lat. 1° S., long. 13° W.

[Footnote 4: Or Falcon (?).--J. A. H. B.]

_Remarks._--Oct. 19th, off Cape Point (Cape of Good Hope). Passed
through numbers of Great Shearwaters, and continued seeing them up to
Algoa Bay. This is the first time I have seen them on this coast, and
they are not included among the birds of S. Africa. On our return, on
November 2nd, we passed smaller numbers of them, chiefly flying to
the S.W. Nov. 16th, off Bejouga Islands, observed a Skua in uniform
brown plumage chasing two grey and white birds, apparently some kind
of pigeon. While one bird was being attacked, the other would rise in
the air and attack the Skua in turn, and this continued till I lost
sight of them. The same day, at 1 p.m., saw what looked like land; on
approach turned out to be enormous flocks of sea-birds feeding and
moving to the N.E. Those we saw afterwards were nearly all Greater
Shearwaters.

Thanks to Mr. T. Southwell, of Norwich, I have the following returns
from the Polar Seas:--


_Voyage of Steamship 'Eclipse' in Polar Seas, from the Log of Capt.
David Gray._

The 'Eclipse' left Peterhead on Feb. 28th, 1884, and Lerwick on March
12th. On that day Bottlenose Whales were seen hurrying northward, as
well as a few "Mallemauks." Lat. at noon 60° 25′ N., long. 0° 41′ W.;
wind true S.; force 4[5]; temp, of air 42°, of sea 44°. At 8 p.m.,
temp, of water 47°.

[Footnote 5: The strength of the wind is according to Beaufort
scale.--D. G.]

March 14th.--Lat. at noon, 66° 4′ N., d. r., long. 3° 50′ W., d.
r. South. Force 9. Temp, of air 42°, of water 40°. Numbers of
"Mallemauks," and one or two "Looms."

March 17th.--Noon. Lat. 72° 23′ N. d. r., long. 5° 44′ W. d. r. E. ½
N. Force 5. Temp, of air 25°, of water 29°. Made the ice at 11.30 a.m.
Slight sludge. Saw several "Snow Birds" (Ivory Gulls), as well as a
flock or two of "Rotges" (Little Auks).

March 20th.--Noon. Lat. 73° 0′ N. d. r., long. 5° 30′ W. d. r. N. 6 E.
½ E.; force 10. Temp, of air 20°, of water 29°. Young ice. "Snow Birds"
and "Burgomasters" were flying N.N.E., which was significant, as these
birds are always present in vast numbers where a large herd of seals is.

April 25th.--Noon. Lat. 73° 28′ N., long. 2° 50′ E.; S. ½ W.; force 5;
temp, of air 36°, of water 29·5°. We passed through the sealing grounds
(where on the 4th to 7th the young brood of seals had been killed).
Many crangs [skinless bodies of the young seals] covered with snow were
still visible, and around them flocked myriads of "Snow-birds" and
"Burgomasters."

April 26th.--Noon. Lat. 73° 25′ N., long. 5° 6′ E.; N.N.W.; force 4;
temp, of air, 24°, of water 29°. Saw many flocks of Eider Ducks going
N.E.; and "Mallemauks" numerous.

April 27th.--Noon. Lat. 74° 15′ N., 4° 30 E.; W.N.W.; force 4; temp,
of air, 17·5°, of water 29°; at the pack-edge. Several "schools" of
old Saddle-back Seals seen going N.E.; and "Rotges," "Looms," and
"Dovekies" also on their northward journey.

May 3rd.--Noon. Lat. 78° 36′ N., long. 1° 13′ E.; N.E. by N.; force
8; temp, of air 15°, of water 29°; at the pack-edge. "Rotges" very
numerous to-day and yesterday.

May 9th.--Noon. Lat. 78° 35′ N., long. 0° 10′ W.; W. ½ S.; force 3;
temp, of air 24°, of water 30·5°; among floes. At five o'clock got into
a large water surrounded with floes. A few "Unicorns" were sporting
about in the still water; flocks of "Rotchies" and "Looms" were flying
hither and thither, and some were swimming about engaged in diving for
"whales'-food," upon which they subsist. A bear or two seen on the floe.

May 12th.--Noon. Lat. 78° 47′ N., long. 2° 41′ E.; N.N.W.; force 2;
temp, of air 18°, of water 29°; among floes. Got into the land-water of
Spitzbergen. Saw many "Mallemauks."

May 15th.--Noon. Lat. 79° 20′ N., long. 2° 55′ E.; S.E.; force 3; temp,
of air 26·5°, of water 29·5°; at pack-edge. A few "Unicorns" seen; and
a Hawk came on board, apparently dying of hunger.

May 16th.--The Hawk seemed to be recovering, but on May 17th fell
overboard and was drowned.

May 27th.--Noon. Lat. 77° 40′ N., long. 3° 20′ E.; S. ½ W.; force 6;
temp, of air 27°, of water 31° The water is very rich with "whales'
food"; "Unicorns" are numerous, and birds in thousands.

June 6th.--Noon. Lat. 77° 53′ N., 4° 25′ W.; temp, of air 35°, of water
31°. "Whales' food" abundant, and birds numerous. A few "Unicorns"
seen, and one bear.

June 7th.--Noon. Lat. 77° 57′ N., 4° 52′ W.; N.W. ½ W.; force 1; temp,
of air 36°, of water 33·5°; floes and loose ice. Narwhals have been
numerous; also birds, chiefly "Rotchies"; and one or two bears.

June 10th.--Noon. Lat. 78° 3′ N., long. 0° 24′. W.; S.W. by S. ½ S.;
force 3; temp, of air 33°, of water 33·5°. Many birds. Quantities of
whales blowing, and greasy water. "Rotchies," "Looms," and Narwhals
numerous.

June 11th.--Noon. Lat. 73° 38′ N., long. 0° 4′ E.; S. ½ W.; force
3; temp, of air 35°, of water 35°. Birds and Seals numerous; a few
"Unicorns" seen; and some bears in sight at 12 p.m.


_Steamship 'Persia.'_

Mr. John S. Alston writes under date of November 4th, 1884,--a date as
will be noted correlating with date of a great rush on our E. Coast
of Britain (J. A. H. B.),--as follows:--"We hope to make Port Said
to-morrow, after a very fair run all the way from home. During the last
three days we have been visited by more little birds than I ever saw
before at sea. So far as I can judge, they were mostly Finches; but
we saw two Quails and, of all birds in the world, a Robin-redbreast,
who most characteristically seemed quite at home; and when he was
frightened by a Hawk, which was in close pursuit of this flock of
birds, Robin quietly hopped down the 'companion' into the engineers'
quarters. I had seen another Robin off Tarifa, the southern point of
Europe, but I was much struck to see this little fellow come on board
flying due south, the nearest land being Cape Matapan, hundreds of
miles away. Of course he may have been blown off shore by a northerly
gale, but when we met him he was flying against a southerly breeze.
The Hawk followed these birds, hovering about the ship all day, but
took his departure in the night. He was a small one--a Merlin, I
think."--(Signed) John S. Alston.




EAST COAST OF SCOTLAND.


The usual schedules were distributed to thirty stations on the East
Coast of Scotland, Faroe, and Iceland. Twelve stations on East Coast
of Scotland have sent in forty-one schedules out of the twenty-eight
stations, including Faroe and Iceland.

From the Isle of May we have, as usual, the heaviest returns--fourteen
schedules in all. Pentland Skerries again comes second with twelve
schedules, and Bell Rock is the next in weight of returns.

In the following List of Stations, we indicate in Arabic type the
number of years in which each station has returned records, and the
consecutive numbers of the stations, as these coincide with those on
the map. Hitherto we have indicated by asterisks, under each year as
a heading, these particulars of returns, but after the fifth year
these become cumbrous, occupying too much room. This year's returns,
however, will again be indicated by asterisks. As will be seen below in
an analysis of the returns for the past six years (see General Remarks
end of W. C. of Scotland), the character of the lights at each station
appears to have considerable influence on the bulking of records, the
_white-fixed-lights_ having the largest as a rule. We mark in the list
of stations therefore their different values as migration stations.
The numerals indicate the true _migration values_, though the class
of light may not _always_ correspond; and it remains to be seen if
their character be kept up in the future. These are indicated by the
following Roman numerals:--

  First Class.--I., usually _fixed white lights_, but may be
     otherwise, if the situation is particularly favourable, as in
     the case of Bell Rock (see below).

  Second Class.--II., usually white-revolving, also intermittent.

  Third Class.--III., white and red revolving

  Fourth Class.--IV., white flash, and red and white sectors.

  Fifth Class.--V., bad situation, or exposure, combined with other
     disadvantages; _red fixed_; landlocked. All considerations bad.

(_a_) Notwithstanding the favourable description of light.


_Diary from the Stations._

_N. Unst._--Mr. James Edgar--formerly at Butt of Lewis--has sent useful
schedules embracing from Feb. 15th to 21st Sep. and to Nov. 28th. "We
have plenty of Ravens and Hooded Crows all the year, therefore I only
notice uncommon flocks." "One pair of Hoodies, which has been about
the rock for years, attends regularly at dinner time (1 p.m.) to eat
up scraps. Their right is sometimes disputed by a half-tame Sea Gull.
I had a good opportunity of examining 'Jenny Wren' this season. She
remained for a fortnight."--_In lit._

_Sumburgh Head._--The old natives say they never before have seen such
vast numbers of Gulls as during this year, around this station all the
season onward from 8th March, 1884.[6]

[Footnote 6: Mr. D. M. Scott has removed to Lamlash, Arran, since the
date of his last schedule, Sept. 15th, 1884, and is succeeded by Mr.
Youngclause from Monach Islands. Mr. Youngclause sends a light schedule
from Sept. 19th to Nov. 16th, of interest in showing the northerly
extension of the migration of Linnets and Turdidæ (see General Remarks
under Gulls).]

_N. Ronaldshay._--Mr. John Tulloch sent one schedule embracing the
whole season from July 5th to Sept. 21st. I did not receive this
till the first week in March. In future I would always like to have
schedules returned immediately after last day of January, or as soon
as possible after that date, as it is more difficult to work in stray
schedules after the Report is written out.

_Pentland Skerries._--Mr. J. Gilmour was called away from August 13th
till Sept. 1st on a Board of Trade inquiry. During that interval a
Solan Goose struck the Lantern Dome, and was found, but not killed
("this is very unusual"). A few Wheatears and one Goldcrest were seen
also, during this interval. Gulls (a pair) bred on the island--a very
unusual circumstance.

Easterly and southerly winds prevailed from March 10th to April 12th,
with occasional S.W., varying to N.; 12th to 19th, N.E., fresh; 19th
to May 4th, again S.E. and E., and N. on latter date, and so on till
August with very slight variations, or light, variable.

In autumn, winds continued to prevail easterly, till about the 20th
Sept., when they changed to westerly and northerly, and this appeared
to be characteristic along the whole E. coast, thus making a visit
paid by me to Isle of May, for three weeks in September and October,
rather unproductive of visible migration. This N. & W. prevalence
caused migration to be much dispersed, and no great rushes are recorded
at Pentland Skerries or other stations. But on the 14th Oct., during
mod. E., after N.N.E. and N.W. gales, a rush of Thrushes and Woodcocks
will be found recorded. Between Oct. 17th and Nov. 7th winds very
variable round three-fourths of compass, but almost never entering the
fourth quarter between S. and E.--indeed only on three days. Strong
N.E., weather cloudy and clear, very little haze. This continued till
Nov. 30th, except on Nov. 11 a S. gale, on 8th S.W. gale, and on 20th a
N. gale.[7]

[Footnote 7: Read the above in connection with General Remarks.]

_Dunnet Head_ gives a light return. The daily to-and-fro migration of
Gannets is spoken of in _general terms_, and the dates of arrival and
departure of rock birds were "about the same dates as stated in last
year's report."

_Cromarty._--The prevailing wind at this land-locked station at the
times of records, given between March 24th and Dec. 26th, were from W.
and S.W. Dates of arrivals in spring and departures in autumn given.
As before remarked, such land-locked stations give abnormal returns as
compared with freely exposed stations, and the S.W. or W. winds were
local.

_Chanonry._--Practically blank as regards actual migration, all
movements being local, Mr. J. McGill finding Scarts and Cormorants
flying up and down the Firth, Wild Ducks feeding in frosty weather,
and many Larks on Jan. 17th, 1884. Local movements of Green Plover in
November and December. No certain migration discernible.

_Kinnaird Head_ returns a blank schedule, with the positive statement
"No birds." I am obliged to the head lighthouse-keeper for returning
this schedule. Such if regularly returned would enable me to give
always, year by year, a positive statement of negative value. I wish
others on the Aberdeenshire coast would follow his good example.

_Girdleness._--A light return during November 14th to 17th and December
1st to 12th. "Birds at this lighthouse very scarce, the situation
being very exposed." A record of a Fork-tailed Petrel (seen by me on
15th August, J. A. H. B.) is of considerable interest. Dead calm and
hazy; on E. side of lantern; about 12 p.m. Stomach contained only
an oily matter (Geo. Sim) _vide_ Proc. Ryl. Phyl. Soc. Edin. 1884.
Bell Rock sends excellent schedules as usual. The early advent of a
swallow--March 13th and 14th--is commented upon by letter. "It seemed
much exhausted." Mr. Hutton, Bank Manager, Royal Bank, Arbroath--a
gentleman much interested in ornithology--gave a full account of the
occurrence in the 'Dundee Advertiser' of April.[8]

[Footnote 8: "About four o'clock in the afternoon of the 13th and 14th
March the light-keeper on duty at the Bell Rock Lighthouse observed a
swallow fluttering in front of the kitchen window. After watching it
for some little time he opened the window and stood aside to see if
the bird would come in. This in a minute or two it did, and alighted
on the inside of the windowsill. So exhausted did the little wanderer
appear from its long flight and the buffetting of the weather that it
allowed itself to be lifted up and put into a cage. It immediately
lay down on the bottom of the cage and instantly fell fast asleep,
remaining in this state till next morning about eight o'clock (sixteen
hours). So sound were its slumbers that the keepers watching it as
it lay could scarcely detect any signs of life in it, and at times
they were almost certain that it had died. On awakening at the hour
mentioned the swallow was taken out by one of the keepers and given a
drink of water. It was put back into the cage again, where it lay in an
apparently dormant condition till 10 a.m., when it was supplied with
more water, under the influence of which and the rays of the sun it
became quite lively and strong. The kitchen window was now lifted up
and the bird taken out and laid on the open hand of Mr. Jack, principal
light-keeper. Resting there for a moment, it gave one cheery twitter,
and, springing upwards from the outstretched palm, it winged its way
in the direction of the land and was lost sight of in the space of
a minute or two. The appearance of the bird so far north at such an
early season is remarkable. The swallow migrates to Africa at the end
of October, and it is not till the middle of April that the flight
northward begins, so that the one which surprised the light-keepers
before March was half run was several weeks earlier than the usual time
for their appearance here. It may be added that, the Swallow being an
insectivorous bird, the lighthouse keepers were unable to supply it
with its ordinary food, and abstained from giving it any other for fear
of injuring it."]

Between April 9th and Sept. 3rd scarcely any migration was observed
at Bell Rock--only four records in that time on April 28th, April
30th, May 7th and 9th. But before and after these dates in spring
and autumn, considerable migration is recorded in comparison, but
decidedly slack, as compared with other seasons, in autumn, owing to
northerly and westerly winds. This, however, was followed by a great
rush in November, for particulars of which the reader is referred to
the details under Species. The marvellous congregations of Gulls and
their prey the Sprat or Garvie (_Clupea sprattus_) are commented upon.
(General Remarks).

_Isle of May._--In January, 1884, intermittent migration continued. The
great gale of 27th to 29th produced nothing of any consequence--one
Yellowhammer, however, being the first of the species seen for some
time.

While rushes took place in spring at Bell Rock in March, with the wind
prevailing E., at Isle of May much smaller movements are recorded,
local winds apparently being more S. & W. (See especially "Thrushes,"
but the remark applies to other species also.) This is curious at
two stations so close to one another. Bush of land birds in April.
Movements of Guillemots and rock birds somewhat different (see
details). Partial albino of the Willow Warbler captured (seen by me,
J. A. H. B.) Long spell of E. winds in April and rushes; but a light
S.W. wind on 30th, changing from S.S.E., brought a "wonderful rush of
land birds." This seems to me interesting, as proving the station to
lie in the direct route of migration, rushes occurring both in the most
favourable winds--S.E. or E. (_i.e._ for spring migration), and those
supposed to lie less favourable, and following winds, _viz._ S.W.

A later schedule--April 30th to June 3rd--shows evidences of a
decidedly late spring migration, for which it seems difficult to assign
a cause. This was also noticeable on land. It took place in second week
of May, with light S.W. and W. wind, mist, fog, and rain; principally
of Warblers and insect-feeding species.

Very few records are given between June 11th and August. A usual return
of Warblers, &c., noted as rather early by August 10th. Bush of same
species, 19th and 24th. In end of August and all September, on till
about October 18th, winds retarded migration, being N. and W.; never,
or very rarely, S. and E., or S. of W. I spent three weeks and three
days on Isle of May, between September 24th and October 17th, and
during that time only witnessed intermittent and slack migration; the
only attempt at a night rush apparent being on the night of October
4th, at the time of total eclipse of the moon--wind Light W. at the
time--some twelve Goldcrests being caught at the lantern.[9] A male
Black Redstart was shot on October 24th, and a second seen on 25th. The
principal rush of the year on November 4th instances the effect of a
sudden change of wind. This must have been a very vast and determined
rush, as many came also with a W. wind afterwards. This rush was
composed principally of Finches and Larks, with considerable numbers
of Turdidæ; but the great rush of the latter (Thrushes) did not take
place till the rush of the Finches was past. Whilst the Finches and
Larks greatest rush was on Nov. 4th, the greatest rush of Thrushes,
Blackbirds, and Turdidæ generally was on 12th to 16th. (For particulars
see details under Species).

[Footnote 9: Our Isle of May notes containing a few items of interest
will be used in a separate paper on that island, but actual results
will be worked into this report also.]

Thereafter migration continued with less force up to Jan., 1885, the
date of the last schedule to hand.

_Inchkeith._--This land-locked station returns a light schedule--of
considerable interest, however, as carrying out what has been remarked
by us in previous reports, that when birds do occur here on migration
it is usually with S.W. and westerly winds, whether in spring or in
autumn. The Siskin seems to frequent Inchkeith as a regular migrant,
and Titmice are also regular in appearance.


Separate Report under Genera and Species.

Turdidæ.--In spring, migration at Sumburgh Head (April only, large
flocks of Common Thrushes on 1st, wind light S.E., clear, along with
Starlings and Linnets), and Pentland Skerries (indication in March,
and partial and remittent in April, but no great rush evident). At
Bell Rock (great rush recorded on 6th and 8th March of Thrushes, Ring
Ouzels, light S.E. wind), and at I. of May, but rush not observable
here on 6th and 8th, there being only two records of Blackbirds and a
few Redwings, owing to local wind being light W. and haze. Earliest
record at I. of May, Feb. 20th, one Redwing with Blackbirds and
Thrushes; a rash, and latest records, also at I. of May, on 29th and
30th April, along with Robins, Redstarts, &c., with S.E., or light
S.W., of Ring Ouzels. Light records in March; on 9th and 10th twenty
Fieldfares--"a good number"--with light N.E., clear, and N.N.E. and
rain.

In autumn the migration was pronounced, and whilst desultory movements
continued during September and October, the heaviest rushes are
recorded in the middle of November. Records of Dippers, one on Aug. 2nd
and another (well described) on Aug. 29th, at I. of May; wind light W.,
clear. The place where they were observed was afterwards pointed out
to me--_viz._, at the edge of a stagnant pool of water near the "Mill
Door" on the I. of May. Earliest record of Fieldfare, Sept. 10th, at
I. of May, light S., haze; latest of same species, on Dec. 31st, and
Jan. 19th, 1885, also at I. of May; variable, haze. Earliest record of
Common Thrush, also at I. of May, the day after, _viz._ Sept. 11th,
light S., haze; and latest, at I. of May also, on Dec. 22nd, when "a
few" were noticed. Earliest Missel Thrush on Sept. 27th (seen by J. A.
H. B.), also at I. of May, with gale, W.S.W., and latest Oct. 14th;
but others, no doubt, have escaped special records, and have been
confused with other species. Earliest Redwings do not appear in the
schedules till Oct. 2nd, also at I. of May (J. A. H. B.); on 7th a few
more, followed by scattered records till Nov. 12th, when old and young
struck in numbers at Bell Rock, and the rush of this and of Fieldfares
took place on the 4th and 5th of November, continuing till the 17th,
with Blackbirds, male and female, and intermittently until December.
Earliest Blackbirds Sept. 11th,--"not many,"--at Isle of May.

Rush of Thrushes, Nov. 7th (light) at Pentland Skerries, and Nov.
30th, at I. of May (considerable). Rush of Fieldfares and Redwings
(indicated) at N. Unst, on Nov. 5th, with a few Blackbirds,--all flying
S.,--indicated at Pentland Skerries, 5th, 7th, to 12th, with Blackbirds
and a few Thrushes and Woodcocks, on 12th. At Dunnet Head a few
Blackbirds and Thrushes seen daily between Oct. 1st and Nov. 13th. Rush
of Ring Ouzels ("great numbers") at Bell Rock; and rush of Fieldfares
and Redwings at I. of May on 4th and 5th. At N. Ronaldshay also a rush
visible on the 8th, with Woodcock, Crows and Rooks; Nov. 7th and 8th,
wind E.S.E., a great rush. All during October the above-named _Turdidæ_
appeared in small numbers, the wind prevailing N. and W., and scarcely
ever S. and E. Stations sending returns of Thrushes are N. Unst,
Pentland Skerries, Dunnet Head, Bell Rock, and I. of May. At the dates
of the rushes they were accompanied by many other species. The rush
at I. of May on 4th and 5th continued in great force after the wind
shifted to S.E., with rain, after wind S. at noon, on 4th ("perfect
weather for witnessing migration"), so fewer Fieldfares again on 5th,
with wind--a W. gale, instancing the abruptness with which migration
ceased owing to changes in the wind. A vast rush of Blackbirds, females
predominating, on 12th, at I. of May, with S. haze and drizzle, but
ceased utterly with change of wind to W. at 9 p.m. All birds striking
on S.E. side, _with_ the wind. Along with this rush came large numbers
of Redwings and Fieldfares, Hooded Crows, one Yellow Bunting, large
number of Larks, Robins, Bramblings, Chaffinches, eight Hedgesparrows,
a few House Sparrows, two Woodcocks (shot). On the 15th Blackbirds
as numerous as ever, but fewer Redwings and Fieldfares; hundreds of
Snow Buntings, flying N. By the 17th Blackbirds were mostly males, but
females had predominated up to that date. In January, 1885, between
4th and 21st, a few light records of Fieldfares and Thrushes, and a
large number (rush?) on latter date. The rush on Nov. 4th consisted of
Siskins and other _Fringillidæ_ (these continuing in small numbers to
the 6th, notwithstanding the change of wind). Mr. Agnew describes this
as the largest rush of migrants this season at the I. of May, and it
must have been very vast, close, and determined, when even on the 6th,
with light W. wind, large numbers of Bramblings and Chaffinches still
appeared. Other species participating besides the above were Siskins,
Woodcocks (six killed), Rock Pipits, one Owl, two Falcons. (See notes
upon weather under "Notes under Stations." We refer back to this
account under other species, to dates).

Saxicolinæ.--Wheatears in considerable numbers at Pentland Skerries and
Isle of May (a rush). Earliest at Isle of May March 26th, light S.,
two; and a few more on 28th at same station, including two old males.
Rush with S.E. to S.W. wind at Pentland Skerries, on April 6th, and
considerable numbers at I. of May on April 3rd. Beyond these there are
no other spring records of this species. On March 31st a single Black
Redstart (_in mus._ Feilden & Harvie Brown) is recorded from Pentland
Skerries; light S.E., haze.[10] We have also three single records of
the true Stonechat at I. of May, on 2nd, 28th and 30th April, and one
at Pentland Skerries on May 14th, light E. wind, struck lantern, not
killed. On April 30th a rush of Redstarts along with Robins, Ring
Ouzels, &c., at Isle of May. This concludes spring records.

[Footnote 10: A full record of this rarity, and of previous occurrences
in Scotland, is given by me in Proc. Ryl. Phyl. Soc. Edin., read 23rd
April, 1884; and a system of Record Forms recommended for tabular and
formal records of rarities in future (see also Report for 1883, p. 81).
We wish observers would recognise the use of some such uniform method,
and we are certain it would save much time and trouble for future
compilers.]

In autumn records from N. Unst, one Redstart (the only one seen this
year) and one Wheatear, on 7th and 12th September respectively; flew
S.W. This is the earliest 1884 record of _Saxicolinæ_ in autumn. Also
from N. Ronaldshay, a number on 15th striking, and Pentland Skerries,
Bell Rock, and I. of May, of Wheatears, a few Redstarts, Whinchats,
&c., and one Black Redstart, old male, shot (_in mus._ I. of May,
present curator Mr. Joseph Agnew). Another was seen the following
day--first on 24th, second on 25th Oct. (recorded in full in Ryl. Phyl.
Soc. Proc. 1885, read 21st Jan., 1885); a Common Redstart seen at
same time.[11] The records of all the species are light, and no rush,
unless of Wheatears, _ut sup._, Oct. 22nd, at Isle of May, increasing
by the 25th. During our stay on the island (27th Sept. to 17th Oct.) we
observed a good many straggling birds. A few accompanied the rush of
other species on Nov. 12th (see Turdidæ). One Whitethroat is returned
from I. of May, striking face of lantern, "facing the wind," on Sept.
12th. Mr. Agnew has the note,--to date of the 19th of September,--"I am
surprised at so few birds with such thick fog." Log, light to strong
E., thick fog, or haze between the 12th and 19th, yet migration was
tardy.

[Footnote 11: All the previous records of this species in Scotland
relate to localities the position of which shows comparatively easily
how they arrived at each. These records now amount to six in all, of
which I have recorded the last three since Mr. Gray wrote his 'Birds of
the West of Scotland.' They are as follows:--

One: collection of Mr. Sinclair of Wick (R. Gray, _op. cit._, p. 84).

One: obtained at Cullen, Banff, by Mr. T. Edward (_ditto_).

One: Kirkwall, Orkney, 20th Dec, 1859 (R. Gray, _op. cit._).

One: Higginsneuk, Stirlingshire, 10th Nov., 1875 (J. A. H. B., Proc. Ryl.
Phyl. Soc, vol. iv., p. 142).

One: Pentland Skerries (J. A. H. B., _op. cit._).

One: Isle of May (as given above).

]

Silviinæ.--At Cromarty, Robins disappeared March 24th. We have then
spring records from Sumburgh Head, Pentland Skerries, Bell Rock, and
Isle of May, all in April. Earliest at Sumburgh Head, April 1st, when
four appeared, strong S.E., haze, but the remark is added, "First time
Robins have stayed all winter." Next records not till 28th, 29th, and
30th, at Bell Rock, Pentland Skerries, and Isle of May, where there was
a rush along with Ring Ouzels. The record at Bell Rock (28th) is one of
very few records between the 9th of April and the 3rd of September.

In autumn, one return on Aug. 25th, as arriving at Cromarty, light
S.W., clear. No more till Nov. 3rd, when "a few" at Isle of May. But
next day a rush of other species (see under Turdidæ). There were,
however, a few Robins frequenting Isle of May in September and October,
and even the indication of a rush.

Phylloscopinæ.--Only a slight indication in spring of Goldcrests'
migration, 2nd, 8th, 16th of April, single records at N. Unst and
Pentland Skerries. But of Warblers a rush at Isle of May, along with
Redshanks, and Robins and Ring Ouzels (see Thrushes), and in May one
Wood Warbler at Isle of May; light S.W.

In autumn:--Goldcrest, earliest appearance at Isle of May, Aug. 31st
(a female), along with a Sedge Warbler, light W., haze; then on Sept.
1st, one at Isle of May, and a few light records, 7th, 8th, 10th,
18th, and 27th. On 7th at N. Unst ("only the second occurrence of it
observed here"), and intermittent and light till 4th Oct., when, during
darkest time and total eclipse of the moon, I assisted in capturing and
identifying twelve Goldcrests at I. of May lantern, about which I may
have more to say in the "General Remarks." Again, on the 24th, numbers
were seen, with light S. wind. Some Chiffchaffs seen at I. of May on
Sept. 11th, and one at lantern on 27th (seen by J. A. H. B.). This
constitutes all the important records of the species of _Phylloscopinæ_.

Titmice.--The only spring records of "Titmice" are 12th, 15th and 24th
May, at Pentland Skerries, in different winds, _viz._ light N.W., fresh
S.W., and light S.E.[12]

[Footnote 12: We wish our reporters could distinguish the species more
exactly. We have six species of "Titmice" in Britain, and possibly
seven on migration. I want wings of Titmice obtained or whole birds.]

In autumn slight movements in September and October; one on Pentland
Skerries on 5th Oct.; one "Titmouse" on I. of May on 9th Sept., and on
Oct. 4th at same station, an indication of Titmice having joined in the
migratory rush of that date, seven appearing, with light W.S.W., wind
and haze. On Oct. 9th we shot a "Blue Tit" (_Parus cæruleus_, L.) on I.
of May, which had been haunting the fields for two or three days; light
W., clear. First actual record of the species by name here.

Acrocephalinæ.--Accentorinæ.--At Isle of May a late rush took place of
Sedge Warblers between 9th and 13th May, along with many other species,
as follows:--Wood Warblers, Cuckoos, Meadow Pipits, Whinchats (vera),
Flycatchers (till 14th), Fieldfares. Mr. Agnew remarks, "long of
coming, and remaining longer than usual." Hedge Accentors bred for the
first time on Isle of May, and I saw the old nest.

In autumn, earliest movement, a rush of Sedge Warblers, 10th August
("this is early"), with fresh S.E. wind and fog. Up to 19th a desultory
movement, but on latter date a rush of Sedge Warblers, Whinchat, Wrens,
Whitethroats (especially on 19th), Chiffchaffs, Starlings (q.v.). Hush
again on 24th of small birds--Whitethroats and Warblers. On 31st a
single Sedge Warbler killed. On Sept. 1st a number of Sedge Warblers,
all at I. of May, light W., clear; and on 4th a number of Accentors
(Hedgesparrows). In October several Accentors at I. of May on 27th, and
a few of the same species on 6th and 7th November, and along with the
general rush on 12th (see Thrushes).

Troglodytidæ.--Earliest record at Sumburgh Head on 22nd March, when
four appeared at 12 noon; light breezes, showery. Also in April at same
station, on 1st and 15th, six Wrens, with S.E., fresh, and haze, and
fresh N., clear, respectively. Also at Pentland Skerries, on 1st April,
one, and one on 12th, with, in both cases, fresh to strong S.E., and
at Bell Rock, on 2nd April, one, strong S.E., haze, flying W., with a
general rush of "small birds" resting or flying W.

In autumn, at N. Unst, Sumburgh Head, and Isle of May. Earliest at
Sumburgh Head, on 7th Sept., seven seen; 12th at N. Unst, fine, one
remained a week; and 17th, at I. of May, one. In October, odd ones on
7th; at N. Unst and Pentland Skerries, a number (almost a rush on I.
of May, on 9th, and increased up to 25th). In November one at N. Unst;
strong N. wind.[13] "Wrens" are also recorded, on Jan. 23rd, 1885, as
still present on Isle of May, probably having wintered there.

[Footnote 13: I feel a little curious about these N. Unst Wrens, and
would like to see one or two.]

Motacillidæ.--As early as Feb. 14th, at I. of May, a single record of a
"Wagtail" flying N.W., clear, fine. [The entry "Wagtail," we presume,
in most cases is applied to the black and white or Pied Wagtail.] On
March 25th one "Wagtail" flying E. over Pentland Skerries, light S.,
clear. At I. of May one on 9th March, a few on 22nd, and "two males
staying to breed" on 28th. On April 1st two single records at Pentland
Skerries, and at Isle of May; wind at both places, fresh S.E., haze.
In May, from 8th to 25th, light records on eight days, four on the
10th (the most), and "several" on the 11th (indication of a rush?).
"Several" again on the 12th. On the 16th one at Bell Rock, light E.,
and on May 14th two Yellow Wagtails, light W. In July, on the 5th, one
"Wagtail," moderate S.E., and one on 20th, light, variable, clear.

In autumn, no records in August. Spasmodic movements in September at N.
Unst, few records, and these single. "Several" at Pentland Skerries on
2nd, strong N.W., and ditto on 8th, light, variable, clear, and on 23rd
ditto, light N.W., showers. On 8th and 9th at Isle of May, indication
of a rush, adult and young, increase on 9th over the 8th; light,
variable, clear. Last record, one on Oct. 9th at Isle of May.

Pipits.--The arrivals and movements of Rock Pipits (or "Mosscheepers"
or "Tang Sparrows") are reported only from Bell Rock and I. of May in
spring, in March and April; earliest 16th March at Bell Rock, latest
7th April; also at Bell Rock. At Bell Rock four single records, 16th,
29th and 30th March, and 7th April, and at I. of May, on 28th March,
"more Rock Pipits arrived." At I. of May about twenty Meadow Pipits
arrived on the 13th of February, and a considerable rush--or at least
indication of a rush--began on the 1st April and increased on the 3rd,
and a further increase observable on the 23rd; winds S. to E. and S.E.

In autumn I have no records till the 13th September, "large numbers,"
at Isle of May, of Rock Pipits,--"a large increase on those already
there,"--and none again at same station till 14th October, when a
number arrived and "all except such as will probably remain the winter"
left on 16th. More again appeared on the 25th, and still more on the
31st; and by the 4th of November a rush, with other migrants. At Bell
Rock only six records of straggling birds between the 5th and 22nd.
Rock Pipits are also given as still on Isle of May on the 23rd January,
having wintered there as predicted. Of Meadow Pipits considerable
numbers, with light E. and fog, at Isle of May, on the 16th and 18th
September, and a few more seen occasionally up to the middle of
October. No other records.

Muscicapidæ.--In spring a rush of Flycatchers noticed at Isle of
May on 4th May, but no other records given from any other station.
Considerable numbers were observed. No other records of any species
during the year.

Hirundinidæ.--In spring I have a single record of a Swallow (Swift?)
as early as 12th March, which arrived much exhausted, with strong S.E.
wind and mist (see remarks under Stations, _antea_). In April only two
records of Sand Martin at N. Unst, on 27th, and at Sumburgh Head on
10th, with light S.W. and S., clear (marked as "not common").

_Land Note._--Allan Water, in Stirlingshire, 13th April, and at Doune,
same county, next day. Became numerous by May 3rd at Bridge of Allan.
Kelso 23rd and 28th March, and again on April 10th (Dr. J. Grieve, _in
lit._).

In May, records from Sumburgh Head in the North, Pentland Skerries,
Cromarty, and I. of May. Earliest at the land-locked station of
Cromarty on 5th, light N. and showers; indication of a rush apparently,
about 11th or 12th, at the more northern stations, and faint
indications at I. of May (eight birds) on 12th, with the remark "very
few this year." On the 20th and 22nd also, simultaneous appearance of a
few at Sumburgh Head and Isle of May--"Records in all, ten in May, at
four stations, on six dates, between the 5th and 22nd." This formula
perhaps shows as well as any method, the distribution and arrivals on
our East Coast.[14]

[Footnote 14: It may not have been apparent to the readers of our
previous and this Report that, in order to arrive at final conclusions,
after our collection of data is considered large enough, a certain
amount of formal sameness and method of recording has been followed by
the Committee throughout. This is for the final development of a system
of easy tabulation at the end when all our data, year with year, come
to be compared and deductions drawn. Our Irish members of Committee
have departed somewhat from this plan of work, but there seems no
reason apparent why their results need not with equal ease be made
workable into the final form of reduction.]

In summer, at I. of May one record of Swallow on 12th July, variable,
light, clear; and one record of Sand Martin at I. of May on 18th July,
fresh W. and clear. _Note._--Summer records of Swallows usually occur
in clear weather; compare with previous reports.

In autumn, in August two records at the more northerly stations, _viz._
Pentland Skerries, on 11th Aug., six birds, with fresh S., haze, and
at Dunnet Head, on 16th of four birds flying E., with S.E. and fog. In
September, Swallows left Cromarty, and were not seen after the 4th, at
1 p.m., wind light S.W., clear; all congregated on a housetop near the
Lighthouse, and left suddenly at 1 o'clock. At Isle of May a few were
observed on two or three dates in October, and on the 28th (Sunday)
twenty were seen at 9 a.m. flying up and down the lee-side of the
island hawking for flies; light S.W., clear.

_Land Notes._--Without receiving any more returns from any East-Coast
station, I myself observed a Swallow (_Hirundo rustica_) hawking
persistently for flies over and across the lawn at Glendoune House,
near Girvan, Ayrshire, on Nov. 8th (see West Coast Report). At
Rothesay, Mr. John Grieve saw none during a stay there till 15th, when
twenty or thirty were seen. None seen by him at Bridge of Allan after
his return there on the 1st October.

Fringillidæ.--As in 1883, both in spring and autumn, Finches show
themselves well to the front in migration; but while in some years
Thrushes and Finches travel much together; in this year, whilst still
many travelled simultaneously, as a glance at our data shows, yet the
great rush of Thrushes did not take place till the rush of Finches was
over. Thus, as will be seen, Green Linnets made a rush over in spring
as early as 10th February, but the rush of Thrushes did not take place
till later--about the 6th March. In the same way, while the greatest
rush of Finches in autumn took place on the 4th November, Thrushes were
not in force till the 10th and 12th. The extension of the migration
of Finches in 1884, in time, dates Feb. 15th (three Grey Linnets at
Pentland Skerries at noon, wind strong S.E. and clear) to Jan. 26th
(four Green Linnets at Isle of May, wind variable, light, clear). The
extension of the migration of Finches (of sorts) in 1884 in N. and S.
direction, ranges from Sumburgh Head,--a single record of great numbers
on the 3rd April, with strong S.E. and haze,--to Isle of May; earliest
date 10th February, followed by rush on 12th; latest date Jan. 26th,
four Green Linnets. To compare with the above, the extension in time
of the Thrushes' migration dates also from Feb. 10th, but movements
were much fewer so early--a single Redwing and a few Blackbirds and
Thrushes, strong S.E., clear, up to 23rd January; rush between 19th
and 23rd of Fieldfares, &c. The extension in N. and S. distribution
ranges from North Unst,--a dozen Fieldfares flying S., light W.,
clear,--through Sumburgh Head; large numbers; and a rush on 1st April,
strong S.E., along with Linnets, rushes at more southern stations
taking place in March, on till our southern stations of Isle of May and
Bell Rock are reached.

Now, taking the above general remarks, we will treat it more in detail,
as this affords a good opportunity of making final tabular comparisons.

In spring, earliest at Pentland Skerries, three Grey Linnets at noon,
as already recorded, light S.E., clear; latest Green Linnets (and
latest Finches), 17th June, one at Isle of May. An early rush of
Green Linnets on 10th Feb., after a N.W. gale previous night, and a
great rush on 12th, with other migrants; and of Thrushes, Bramblings,
Chaffinches and House Sparrows, at Isle of May. Intermittent movements
during March at Pentland Skerries and Isle of May and Inchkeith,
flocks of Chaffinches, Grey Linnets (25th), Bramblings, Green Linnets,
and four Siskins (at Inchkeith on 25th, with light S.W. wind, with
which, being a land-locked station, this species usually occurs),
two Bullfinches, at Bell Rock, on 31st March, flying W. In April
Chaffinches, Grey Linnets, and one Sparrow at Pentland Skerries,
between 5th and 22nd; wind prevailing S.E., except on 12th and 17th,
when light N.E. At Bell Rock one House Sparrow (female), exhausted,
died after feeding on 31st. From the 9th April, when one Bullfinch
was seen (and one the day before), scarcely any migration observed
until Sept. 3rd--a few records only of "small birds" on April 28th
and 30th and May 7th and 9th. At Isle of May a rush ("evidently") of
many species, including Tree Sparrows, Bramblings (males), Chaffinches
(males, but some females), from the 3rd, and during 4th, 5th and 6th,
to 10th. The female Chaffinches came on 6th to 10th, but mixed males
and females on the 10th. Tree Sparrows abundant. Rush tailing off,
with light returns, on 10th, 16th, 17th and 23rd to 30th. In May Grey
Linnets are reported to arrive, for the purpose of breeding, at Isle
of May on the 29th. Other records run rarely of this species, and only
a few intermittent records of birds flying W. or N.W. at Pentland
Skerries, and a single bird at Bell Rock between 9th and 30th. One
Sparrow (male) on 7th, and two on 9th, at Pentland Skerries; and two
Bullfinches, flying W., with strong E.S.E. and haze--the only other May
records. In June the last of the Tree Sparrows on 13th at Isle of May,
strong S.E., completely ends the spring records, and we do not have
another of any Finches till Sept. 8th.[15]

[Footnote 15: The bulk of the autumn records will not admit of
treatment _in extenso_, as they are heavy, so we will cut them shorter
than the spring ones.]

In autumn, no records in July or August recorded. Very light in
September: two records of Grey Linnets on the 8th at Pentland Skerries,
and of Siskins at Inchkeith on 10th; latest on Jan. 26th, four Green
Linnets. Rushes (or indications) at Pentland Skerries and Isle of
May, between 4th and 7th, of several species; Grey and Green Linnets,
Bramblings, and an increase of Chaffinches on 25th and 27th. A rush
of Linnets (and Larks) at Inchkeith on 23rd, with light S. breeze;
"continuous flocks all day flying round." Most northern records of
Finches in autumn at Sumburgh Head on 12th October. Great rush,
4th November, with many other birds; wind S. and haze during the
night, S.E. in morning, and rain at 10 a.m. ("perfection of weather
for visible migration"). At 9 p.m., gale from S.W. and heavy rain.
Nevertheless, so persistent or so vast was this rush, that, even with
W. gales and showers, a few Chaffinches, Tree Sparrows, House Sparrows,
and Green Linnets were seen migrating at Isle of May--the largest
numerical rush of migrants there this season; continued intermittently
to end of December.[16] Large numbers on 12th December, flying N.,
light W., haze. Mr. Agnew has the note, "Never saw so many Finches in
one year as this."

[Footnote 16: Since the above was written out I have received the
January schedule from the Isle of May, and in it intermittent movements
of Green Linnets and Bramblings up to 26th--the latest date--are
recorded.]

Corvidæ.--In Spring, Rooks are recorded from Pentland Skerries, Bell
Rock, and Isle of May. Earliest date, Pentland Skerries 14th February,
two seen on island, fresh S. Latest also at Pentland Skerries on 14th
May. Light S. No rushes very apparent. Largest numbers, six on March
10th at Pentland Skerries, and eight on April 19th at same station.
Most records (on different dates), in March six, and in April four.
Fewest records (on different dates) in February two, and in May two.
Direction of wind and weather on dates of record in February:--Fresh
S., on 14th, two birds seen on Pentland Skerries; Fresh S. clear, on
23rd one seen at Pentland Skerries. In March, S.E. gale, rain on 9th,
two or three seen at Pentland Skerries; light airs, variable, snow on
10th, six seen at Pentland Skerries; calm, haze on 4th, one seen flying
S.W. at Bell Rock; light S.E. on 8th, one rested on dome of lantern.
Fresh S. breeze on 13th, one seen flying W.S.W.; light W.S.W., haze,
one flying S.W. on 22nd. In April:--light S.E. on 3rd, one seen at
Pentland Skerries; light S.E. on 5th, four seen at Pentland Skerries;
fresh N.E. on 19th, when eight seen at Pentland Skerries; N.E. light
clear on 3rd at Bell Rock, one resting on window. In May:--strong N.
on 6th, at Pentland Skerries, two seen; light S. on 14th, one seen at
Pentland Skerries.

In July one record of Rooks at Pentland Skerries, fresh N.W.

In autumn, Rooks are recorded from N. Unst, Sumburgh Head, Girdleness,
but much scarcer than in spring. Earliest date, 12th September, a pair,
seen at N. Unst, flying S.W., and one on 19th at same place, also
flying S. Latest, December 4th, at Girdleness, "large flocks,"[17]
rushes, none apparent, unless any accompanied the rushes in October
of Hooded Crows, but none recorded as accompanying the latter. Only
records on two days in September, one day in November, and one day in
December.

[Footnote 17: May only have been of local significance, but cannot say,
as direction of wind and flight is not given in schedule.]

In Spring, Hooded Crows (_Corvus cornix_, L.) are reported from
Pentland Skerries, Bell Rock, and Isle of May. Earliest, February 23rd,
at Pentland Skerries; latest, May 3rd at Pentland Skerries. No great
rush; less than usual. Mr. Agnew's note at April 10th, "very few Hooded
Crows this year." It is difficult even to fix an indication of a rush.
All the records of Hooded Crows and Carrion Crows occur with either
fresh S. or light S.E., excerpt a few of the latter, with N.E. clear,
on April 15th. Of Carrion Crows, a slightly larger and more compressed
migration, beginning on 8th March with twelve seen, ending 15th April;
and an indication of a rush between 8th and 15th, flying N., recorded
only from Bell Rock and Isle of May.

In autumn, a more decided movement of Hooded Crows, with a few Carrion
Crows (the latter on October 24th to 26th), records from Sumburgh Head,
N. Ronaldshay, Pentland Skerries, Girdleness, and Isle of May (none
noted at Bell Rock). Earliest, at N. Unst (most northerly station); on
Nov. 7th one got in court with broken wing, and at N. Ronaldshay on
8th, numbers; strong S.W. Next earliest, on 11th at Pentland Skerries,
3 seen. Mod. S., clear. Latest on December 4th at Pentland Skerries,
and at Girdleness on January 4th at former, and Dec. 4th at latter
(with large flocks of Rooks at the latter). Decided rush between Oct.
11th and 26th at Pentland Skerries (14th), Mod. E., and at Isle of May.
The numbers recorded are, on 11th and 12th one shot by J. A. H. B.;
no more till 23rd, eighteen flying N. (and Rooks), forty on 24th and
forty on 25th, with one Carrion Crow. Continued on 26th; one lighted on
lantern (rare). Again, in November; a number for some days (along with
Ravens, at Sumburgh Head on 10th); also at Pentland Skerries a few, and
the indication of a rush at Isle of May, on the 12th to 15th, flocks of
nine and twelve having been seen on these dates.

Other species mentioned are Jackdaws, a few in February, at Isle of
May, stayed between 16th and 21st, and one seen on 25th. None anywhere
in March, but resident from April 1st till August 1st, when all left.
Besides these, a few passing birds at Pentland Skerries, on April 4th
("rare"), "fatigued," fresh S.E., and two on 19th, fresh N.E. Three
also on 22nd at Isle of May, fresh S.E. haze, and in May at Pentland
Skerries, one, N.W., clear; resting on island. Jackdaws have one entry,
August 1st at Cromarty. The note is added "have all left." In October,
one Jackdaw again at Pentland Skerries (marked again, "rare"), light
W., rain.

Ravens.--One record on April 4th; three seen at Sumburgh Head, probably
resident at Fetlar, or in the vicinity. A number are recorded on one
date in autumn, also at Sumburgh Head on October 10th. These spring and
autumn movements may safely, we think, be looked upon as local and not
regular migrations.

Cypselidæ.--_Land Note._--At Bridge of Allan, Stirlingshire, "Forth,"
first seen on May 9th after a wet day and cloudy; quite numerous on
11th; a warm sunny day.

Sturninæ.--All records of Starlings--spring and autumn--are light.
Earliest in Spring, Feb. 15th, one at Sumburgh Head and a flock at
Isle of May. Latest, Dec. 26th (autumn), a few at Isle of May. Most
spring records in March; five records at four stations (Sumburgh Head,
Pentland Skerries, Bell Rock, and Isle of May); on 7th (Sumburgh Head),
5th (Bell Rock), 2nd, large flock (Isle of May), and 17th (Pentland
Skerries). Prevailing wind S.E., and haze. In April great numbers on
3rd (young birds) at Sumburgh Head, and large numbers on 15th. At
Inchkeith a pair built for the first time for eight years, and reared
young.

In autumn, large flocks every day, about beginning of August, at Isle
of May (earliest) up to September 19th, when all left, mostly young. Up
to date, wind easterly, changed on 20th to W. An increase observed on
October 25th at Isle of May again. Intermittent and rare in November,
all over, and on 18th a strong S.E. gale, apparently drove them all
away. In December a few seen on 12th and 26th, and a few on Jan. 12th,
1885.

Larks.--Spring, heavy migration, but confined in time. Earliest
February 5th, at Bell Rock, and a few on eight dates at Bell Rock,
prevailing E. and S.E.; on 5th, light W. on 14th, 15th, and 16th,
varying from gale S.E. at 9 p.m., on 15th, to W. Latest, April 3rd,
at Sumburgh Head, great numbers (along with Thrushes). Greatest rush,
March 6th, at Bell Rock. All left 7th and 8th, and were succeeded by a
"great flock" on 8th again (with Thrushes) striking and rebounding into
the sea.

In autumn, no records till September 9th, then one at Bell Rock;
two other records in September, one at N. Unst and one at Pentland
Skerries. On Dec. 14th a rush took place, with S.W. gale and sleet.
Between 12th and 16th Nov. a great rush at Bell Rock and Isle of May;
on change of wind from light S. to W. at 10.30 all left on 12th, but
were succeeded by great rush on 15th. The greatest rush on 12th (see
Thrushes). Another rush appears to have taken place on January 28th
and 31st, and intermittent movements on 25th and a few other dates; a
number on the 20th.

Emberizidæ.--Yellow Buntings at Isle of May, February 15th, two all
day; light S.E. showers (earliest records of any Buntings). In March
5th, seven Buntings at Isle of May, fresh N.W. clear; and on 31st two
Corn Buntings at Isle of May, fresh N.W. clear; and on 31st two Corn
Buntings, fresh S. In April two single records of "Buntings," 5th
and 21st, light S.E. with a movement of other species. In May, three
records of Corn Buntings, on 2nd, 12th, and 22nd, at Pentland Skerries,
W. and variable. In July a common (Corn) Bunting was observed at
Pentland Skerries, on 7th, moderate S.E., fog.

In autumn, returns light, as compared with most years. Earliest Snow
Bunting at Pentland Skerries on September 17th ("first seen"), one
bird. In October, very few at Pentland Skerries and Isle of May, but
thousands--a rush of Snow Buntings--at N. Ronaldshay on 12th and 25th
October. Rush November 12th to 15th (with other species). Snow Buntings
usually appear with gales and snow and sleet, but this year have come
in clear weather as a rule. Great numbers at N. Ronaldshay on December
5th, and have been there since last date. A few stray records of Yellow
Buntings in December, and in January, 1885, and one flock of Snow
Buntings on Jan. 4th, 1885.

Cuculidæ.--Only records are May 11th, one at Isle of May, and at same
station June 11th and 17th, light S.E. and clear, both dates.

Strigidæ.--No records.

Falconidæ.--As usual there are numbers of records of Hawks, Falcons,
&c., at most of the island stations--so many indeed that we consider it
unnecessary to notice them in full, as we have hitherto done, except
where rarities occur or where distinct migratory movements are clearly
seen. Records of Falconidæ run all through the year in most seasons,
and generally apparent, mostly due to local flights, pursuing waders or
land birds. Thus in February, March, April, and May; but apparently, in
1884, not observed in June and July, re-appear in August, September,
October and November, but are not recorded in December this year.
Lightest returns in February, March, April and May in spring; lightest
in August, November and December in autumn. Heaviest returns in
September and October. They participate _less_ in spring migration, and
search of food, as at that time they have more local habits and are
preparing their nesting-places, but _more_ in autumn, because the young
are hatched off, able to look after themselves, and working hard in the
"struggle for existence."

The species mentioned in spring are as follows:--Game Hawk (Peregrine
Falcon), Merlin, Eagles (seen several times at Sumburgh Head in April,
breeding near at hand), Sea Eagles, Sparrowhawks. And in autumn, Game
Hawk, Kestrel, "Yellow-spotted Hawk", "Large Yellow-spotted Hawk,"
(Isle of May) Merlin, Large Blue-backed, "with a white ring round front
of the neck, too small for a Goshawk."

_Note._--We want badly to have specimens for identification of
different Hawks.

In September we have ten records of above species, at two stations,
and in October ten more also at the same stations, _viz._: Pentland
Skerries and Isle of May; on eight dates in September and eight dates
in October.

We do not think more minute data will serve any useful purpose, except
where decided migrations of large numbers of Hawks are observed, or
distinctly foreign or new and unusual species.

Pelecanidæ.--We have records of Solan Geese in every month in the
year except January, November and December, but on only one date
in February, three in March, four in April; but bulking heavier.
Great numbers in May, continuing in June, increasing in July, and
continuously in flocks in September. But in October only one record,
and that on the 2nd. We will yet have to see where all our Gannets
congregate during these three months; they are absent from our British
coasts, or, at least, at their scarcest.[18] From the date of the first
(February) record the almost invariable direction of flight given is
"flying east," or easterly; but one record at Sumburgh Head gives "a
number flying N. on April 11th, light N. clear,"[19] on to the date of
September 17th. But on the 19th September an unmistakable change takes
place, and while we still find up to October 2nd, Solans flying east,
we also find that from Sept. 19th Solans were also flying west, past
all the stations sending returns, _viz._, Pentland Skerries and Dunnet
Head. I wish more correspondents both on East Coast of Scotland, at say
Noss Head and Buchanness, and St. Abb's Head, and on the West Coast at
Barra Head, Stoir Head, and Rhinns of Islay, would return daily records
of the movements of Gannets, specially noting the direction and flight
of flocks.

[Footnote 18: See Mr. Anderson's notes on Atlantic 220 miles from
Boston in May, and his notes also off Cape St. Vincent in January,
1885, in the present report, p. 4, and evidence of the migrations of
this species in previous reports.]

[Footnote 19: At Sumburgh Head the migration appears local, "passing
N. or S. during the herring fishery." In this connection see General
Remarks regarding Gulls, at the end of West Coast of Scotland, and the
movements of sprats (_Clupea_).]

Solan Geese bulked largest in July, flying E., and the return rush
appears to have taken place two months after, in September. On January
5th, 1885 there is one record of five Solans flying E. Fresh W. cloudy
at Pentland Skerries. We would ask Mr. Gilmour, or the principal
light-keeper at this station, to carefully record any movements of
Solans during the winter months which come under his observations.

Since the above was written a late schedule from N. Ronaldshay reports
Solan Geese flying north every day between July 5th and about Sept. 1st
in flocks all day of torn two or three to twenty.

To 1885.--In February, 1885, seven Gannets flying W. on 12th, and three
on 21st.

Ardeidæ.--Herons are recorded from March to June sparingly. None in
July or August. Sparingly again in September, none in October, and a
few in November,--a very light migration as compared with 1882.

Anatidæ.--Thirteen Swans at N. Unst seen flying N.W. on April 3rd,
light airs, clear, and at same station three seen resting on the loch
on Oct. 30th, wind light S.W. and rain. Of geese no spring records.
In autumn, fifteen Wild Geese on Oct. 26th, flying S.; strong W. gale
on 25th, and N.W. on 26th. In November, three grey geese seen flying
west at Pentland Skerries; wind fresh W.N.W. clear (marked "rare").
Of Eider Ducks, earliest notice at Isle of May, a few small flocks on
March 23rd, W. to N.W.; a large flock ("very few hitherto") on April
19th, and another (the same?) on May 11th. No more, except such as
breed there, at least no records till Sept. 24th; thirty-four Eiders
(three old males and one King Eider with them). This flock had,
however, been frequenting along shore for some days. The King Eider was
a splendid male, and was watched a whole day at six or eight different
vantage-points with a powerful glass. Next day, while all the Eiders
were still there, this bird disappeared. During the three weeks I spent
on Isle of May in September and October, flocks of Eiders were never
absent, shifting their position according to the direction of the wind,
and diving, as is their habit, in the very midst of the angry surf. The
largest number counted in a flock was fifty (six males) on Oct. 6th.[20]

[Footnote 20: I saw some thirty or forty dead Eider Ducks and Drakes at
a birdstuffers in Edinburgh in February, shot in Orkney by a Mr. Scott,
of Meadow Bank, Edinburgh; I should be glad if Mr. Scott would tell me
if he shot them for sport, or for what reason.]

Teal, one record at Pentland Skerries on June 25th, light N.W., resting
on island; and one Wigeon at Isle of May on June 11th; one Wild Duck,
one Teal, Isle of May, Oct. 1st; large numbers of Wigeons and Scaups in
the Moray Firth by Nov. 16th, and Barnicle Geese; one Teal and one R.
B. Merganser, shot at Isle of May (_in mus._ Isle of May) on 25th and
27th Nov. But at N. Ronaldshay Eiders began to arrive by September 1st,
and remain all winter in hundreds.

Columbidæ.--Wood Pigeons: one at Isle of May on 6th September, light
W., clear; a large flock flying N.W., wind N., light, clear, on 14th
November; about one hundred on 26th, flying N., wind light W.N.W. No
other records from any other station. An increase on resident numbers
of Rock Doves observed at Pentland Skerries on 14th November.

_Land Note._--In January, at Glenboerie, Stirlingshire, Stock Doves
appeared, and my keeper sent in two along with two Wood Pigeons.
This species is rapidly spreading and increasing in Scotland.
(See last Report, p. 25.[21]) This is the first record in E. of
Stirlingshire.--J. A. H. B.

[Footnote 21: See Mr. Cordeaux's report on Stock Doves crossing German
Ocean and General Remarks.]

Rallidæ.--Corn Crake arrived at Pentland Skerries, 17th May; heard
first time at Cromarty on 14th May; and one recorded at Isle of May,
with rush of other migrants, on the 11th.

In autumn, the last old Corn Crakes were seen at Pentland Skerries,
but young are still on island on 12th September; but on 7th November,
at same station, one young bird was still frequenting the island; and
on 8th January is again recorded, with the remark, "This bird seems to
have been here all the season;" and therefore the records above, from
12th September to 8th January, 1885, probably all refer to the same
solitary young bird, which, perhaps unable to leave at the time, yet
has been able to survive the winter. We would like to hear more of this
bird's behaviour, if Mr. J. Gilmour can give us further notes.

Charadriadæ.--Lapwing or Peewit, a light movement only in spring, and
scarcely any records at all in autumn. A few at Sumburgh Head on 14th
and 22nd; light S.S.E.; and on 25th, fresh N., a few all day on island;
a few single or light entries in March at Isle of May; most (seven) on
17th; and in June, two on 9th, at Sumburgh Head; lighter returns than
in 1883, even; one at Pentland Skerries, 1st December. Scarcely any
movements of Golden Plover recorded, and only at Pentland Skerries,
4th July, a flock; several one day in August, fresh S.E., fog; and at
Sumburgh Head large flocks on 26th and 28th September. At N. Ronaldshay
flocks of Golden Plover visit the island, about the 25th August, and
many remain all winter. Oystercatchers, few records are given; two at
Pentland Skerries on 16th March, and very large numbers at Sumburgh
Head on 29th August.

Scolopacidæ.--Scarcer in spring than in 1883, and no rush appreciable;
no records in April, and only stray entries on 16th, 25th, and 30th
May. In July various slight records; all local migrations for food,
no doubt, even when flocking together; or it may be, beginning to
migrate, when in flocks, on 22nd and 24th July; and from that, on
to 21st October, flocks on many dates; wind S.E. in September at N.
stations up to 20th, or thereby; but in October northerly and westerly,
or N.E. gales. When direction of flight is given it is usually East in
autumn, distinguishing, of course, between real migrants and only local
movements. Fifty Curlews at N. Ronaldshay on 22nd August; remain all
winter; and a few shot usually by Mr. J. Tulloch.

In autumn, a considerable migration; a good Woodcock year. Earliest
migrants recorded: one at Pentland Skerries, 14th October, moderate E.,
after a N.N.E. gale; with Snipe, and rush of other species. Latest,
about 17th November, at Isle of May; five shot. Rush of Woodcocks
between 12th and 17th, at Pentland Skerries; but especially at Isle of
May, on 4th (six shot), 11th (four shot), 12th (ten shot). Few records
in October, and this migration was delayed by adverse winds during
that month.[22] A number are scheduled from N. Ronaldshay, on the
island, all day; on 8th November light S.W. and rain, and the remark,
"I never saw so many Woodcocks on the island since I came here." All
left in a few days. One on 2nd December, at Isle of May; and on 12th
and 20th January, 1855. Of Snipe, not many records. Earliest, one at
Isle of May, 23rd April; and on 1st May at Pentland Skerries. Three
Jack Snipe at same place, 4th July (an unusually early arrival, J. A.
H. B.), moderate E., fog. Latest, four at Isle of May, 28th November;
and Jack Snipe, one at Isle of May on 25th; few records in October;
but indication of a rush in November, with other species, between
16th and 20th. At North Ronaldshay numbers of Snipe seen rising out
of all marshy places on 17th November. One Jack Snipe torn open in
striking.[23] At Torwood, near this, I saw nineteen Woodcocks shot on
13th December (J. A. H. B.), and many other good bags of Woodcock are
on record this autumn and winter. They were, however, unusually scarce
in the shooting season. Of Waders, generally, there are many entries,
including Redshanks, "Sandpipers," Purple Sandpipers (Isle of May and
Pentland Skerries), Turnstones, Ringed Plover and Dunlin (Isle of May),
which we do not consider it necessary to detail. The rushes of other
species indicate also the details of the above.

[Footnote 22: One Woodcock struck hard on the west side of the dome at
Isle of May, flying dead against light east wind, and was found next
morning 100 yards to the N.E., and shot by a friend. Its breast was
torn open, and much lacerated. It may have struck the side of the dome,
and glanced off; but we were in the lantern-room at the time, and it
sounded on the W. side. It had evidently dropped after striking outside
the balcony, and then, recovering, flew straight for the Pilot House,
the white-washed walls of which were reflecting the lantern-light.]

[Footnote 23: Some birds, even in light winds and haze, seem more
impetuous than others at the lantern-lights, such as Woodcock and
Snipe.--J. A. H. B.]

Sterninæ.--Few records. Terns arrived at Pentland Skerries on 11th May;
and at Cromarty the Lesser Tern arrived on 4th May. The Terns left
about the 20th August, and the Lesser Terns on the 15th, with light
S.W. wind. In September a flock of Terns passed Bell Rock on the 15th,
and on the 17th a flock kept round the lantern all night, strong N.W.,
and disappeared with daylight.

_Note._--The birds called the Laughing Gull, by Mr. Agnew, are the
Common Gull (_Larus canus_), not common at Isle of May.

_To Mr. Agnew._--The true Laughing Gull is an American species; and
our Black-headed Gull (_Larus ridibundus_) may also be confused with
your "Laughing Gull." "Common Gull" is the correct name of the bird you
describe and name "Laughing Gull."

Laridæ.--Kittiwakes arrived in great numbers at N. Unst on 13th March,
strong S., hail and sleet. Gulls and rock birds arrived in great
numbers at Sumburgh Head on 8th March, and again on 24th, light N.E.,
haze.[24] Kittiwakes arrived first on 16th March at Isle of May, and
great many more on 24th, wind from W. to N.E. Great Black-backed Gulls
are mentioned at Sumburgh Head and Pentland Skerries on 4th February
and 4th March respectively. Three "Bonxies" seen at N. Unst, 20th
April, the first arrivals, light E.N.E., clear. Richardson's Skuas, a
number at Sumburgh Head, 3rd May, S. gale and snow. Kittiwakes first
appeared at (or first record at) Pentland Skerries, 5th May (?). They
began to return west, by our records, on 23rd July, several flocks of
Gulls, flying W. Skuas, occasional records at Pentland Skerries; are
apparently local in August. Kittiwakes all left Isle of May on 29th
August, and hundreds of Gulls arrived. Flocks of Gulls all September
at most stations, but no unusual numbers noted. "Gulls and Cormorants
(J. A. H. B.) were wheeling high in air; not a good sign of the coming
weather."[25] Iceland Gulls (called also "Snow Birds," in common with
Snow Buntings) first appeared at N. Unst on 1st October, again seen
on the 4th. "Gulls," of sorts, abundant at Isle of May by Nov. 17th;
and garvies, or "sprats" (_Clupea sprattus_), in vast shoals round the
island (see General Remarks). At North Ronaldshay numbers of Gulls
seen, and a good many Black-backed Gulls remaining and feeding on the
people's turnips! (or slugs or worms, J. A. H. B., 21st December).
Lesser Black-backed Gulls, Herring Gulls, Great Black-backed Gulls,
Kittiwakes, Black-headed Gulls, two common Skuas (J. A. H. B.), _L.
catarractes_, a few Glaucous Gulls, one Little Gull recorded by J. A.
H. B. at Kincardine, on the Firth of Forth. All the above species were
frequenting the Firth of Forth, the Kittiwakes and commoner Gulls in
hundreds and thousands. Sprats sold at 14_s._, 12_s._ to 8_s._ per ton
at S. pier, at Kincardine; fields covered, mud covered, sea covered,
air filled with Gulls. No such vast assemblage of Laridæ in Scotland
since the invasion of Arctic Gulls in 1872-73 (see Proc. Glasg. Nat.
Hist. Soc, Jan. 7th and 28th, 1873). The estuary of the Tay was quite
deserted by garvies, or sprats, this season, and few Gulls seen
there.[26]

[Footnote 24: See Oldest Inhabitant's remarks on the unusual abundance
of Gulls all the season onwards, from 8th March, at this station, in
connection with the migration of sprats in winter of 1884--85, and
congregation of Gulls in Firth of Forth (_vide_ General Remarks at end
of West Coast of Scotland),]

[Footnote 25: In autumn there are a few Shags, or Green Cormorants, at
Isle of May; but a colony, or roosting and fishing community of about
fifty to sixty Cormorants, occupy the rock-ledges.]

[Footnote 26: Inside the dock at Bo'ness a man filled his boat, which
held seven tons, twice in rapid succession. About 350 tons were brought
into Bo'ness and trucked off. A much larger quantity I suspect was
obtained at Kincardine.]

Procellariidæ.--August, September, October, and November each contain
a few records at N. Unst, Sumburgh Head, Pentland Skerries, and Isle
of May. Earliest, 11th August, at N. Unst, one struck, not killed,
fresh S.E., fog; and several struck on 19th. On 14th September several
rested all night, from 11 p.m. to daylight, at N. Unst, fresh S.E.;
and one next day struck, light S., fog; and one caught at Sumburgh
Head same night. On 18th October one found, struck, but not killed;
light, variable, rain. In November one struck at N. Unst; on the 16th
November, "a young bird, having still the down." I have recorded also a
Forked-tailed Petrel (_Thalassidroma leachii_), at Girdleness, on 15th
August, 1884 (see Ryl. Phyl. Soc. Proc, 1885, read 21st January, 1885).

Alcidæ.--Razorbills and Guillemots, and Puffins: February 15th,
several "Marrots" first seen, forenoon; strong S., clear; at N. Unst.
February 3rd, large numbers of Razorbills and Guillemots arrived at
Isle of May; seven killed at a shot. February 7th, large numbers of
Razorbills and Guillemots arrived at Isle of May; light W., clear.
February 20th, large numbers of Razorbills and Guillemots arrived at
Isle of May. February 24th, Puffins innumerable at N. Unst; first seen;
light S., clear. February 24th, Guillemots in flocks flying S.E.,
at Sumburgh Head; first seen. February 27th, Guillemots, continuous
flock flying S.E. March 6th, Guillemots and Razorbills, thousands
at Isle of May: "They have remained ever since they came, which is
unusual; but some days more than others."--J. A. March 6th to 30th,
ever increasing numbers of Razorbills and Guillemots; greatest rush of
arrival at Isle of May on 30th. April 4th, multitudes, but all left at
4 p.m.; Isle of May. April 8th, multitudes in the morning. April 8th,
multitudes, and now remain: "Arrived at night, as is usual when they
intend to remain."--J. A. April 22nd, Puffins, which breed at Pentland
Skerries, first arrived on 22nd. May 6th, at Pentland Skerries, a
flock of Guillemots flying E. May 29th, flocks all day flying E. June
6th, six Guillemots flying W. July 8th, a flock flying E. at Pentland
Skerries. September 5th, all rock birds seen last at N. Unst on this
date. November 19th, forty or fifty Cormorants seen flying S. at 4
p.m. Query: "Are those the birds which were roosting on Isle of May in
September and October, or passing birds?"--J. A. H. B. December 12th
and 13th, large numbers; and again on 29th, at Isle of May. Unusually
abundant in Firth of Forth, with Little Auks and Puffins, in January,
1885.

Our report on the E. coast of Scotland includes all schedules between
February 1st, 1884, and January 31st, 1885, which have come to hand in
time.[27]

[Footnote 27: It is important for me to have all schedules dating as
near as possible to January 31st in each year returned as filled up to
date, as the work of arranging the large amount of material is much
simplified if _all_ schedules are to hand as soon after the last entry
as possible.]




EAST COAST OF ENGLAND.


Schedules were sent to thirty-eight stations, lighthouses and
light-vessels, on the East Coast of England, and returns have been
received from twenty-six.

Independent reports have been received from Malmo, Sweden; Stevns
Fyr (lighthouse of Stevns), Zealand; and from Heligoland. Also from
several land stations on the East Coast, namely Northumberland coast,
Seaton-Carew, Redcar, Flamborough, Spurn, Great Cotes (Lincolnshire),
Blakeney and Cley, Wells and Cromer (Norfolk), Yarmouth and the
Isle of Thanet; altogether thirty-seven reporting stations against
thirty-five in 1883. The total number of schedules sent in is seventy,
a considerable increase on previous years, and the labour of arranging,
tabulating and reporting thereon has been considerably increased.

The schedules received from the light-keepers are very satisfactory;
they register an immense amount of special information relating to the
passage of migrants in the spring and autumn of 1884; the entries are
so numerous, and the mass of materials so large, that it is impossible
to give more than the general results of the collected observations.

The notes from land stations, courteously placed at our disposal by
independent observers, many of whom are practical ornithologists of
long standing and repute, add greatly to the value of the report, and
go far to establish the approximate correctness of the details as given
in the separate remarks on each species.

Our thanks are due to Frank K. Newton, Professor H. Lütken, H. Gätke,
T. H. Nelson, C. Donald Thompson, Matthew Bailey, W. Eagle Clarke, the
Rev. H. H. Slater, Philip Lawton, J. H. Gurney, J. F. D. Power, M.
Vaughan, and Lord Clifton, for kind co-operation and assistance, either
in direct communication or by access to their unpublished field notes,
some of which will probably subsequently appear in the Journals and
Proceedings of various Natural History Societies.

The greatest number of schedules received from any one station are nine
from Mr. Thomas H. Cutting of the Inner Farn Lighthouse, and four from
Mr. Owen Boyle of the Languard Lighthouse.

Oct., and again from Nov. 4th to 12th. Great Cotes, Nov. 22nd, a rush.
Many also came in at Whitby on Jan. 10th, 1885. Heligoland, Sept. 18th,
first, and a few through the month; throughout October, but in less
number from the 22nd to 30th, and on to Nov. 10th; great many 22nd and
28th, and a few at intervals to Dec. 24th.

_T. iliacus_, Redwing.--Spring, 1884: Longstone L.H., March 14th,
S. misty, several round lantern. Autumn: Spurn, a few in the last
fortnight in September. Isle of Thanet, Sept. 30th, first. Between the
Farn Islands and Hasborough L.V. at various stations from Oct. 1st to
Nov. 15th; rushes on Oct. 21st to 24th, wind S. and S.W., and Nov.
12th, 13th and 15th. Heligoland, Oct. 7th to 18th; 19th, early, flights
of hundreds; 22nd and 23rd, great numbers; last on Nov. 16th.

_T. pilaris_, Fieldfare.--Spring, 1884: Last at the Spurn, twenty on
May 9th. Autumn: The first at Farn L.H. Oct. 15th, and between this
date to Jan. 10th, 1885, at intervals at stations covering the whole
east coast. In fact, since the middle of October to the second week
in the new year, Fieldfares, Red-wings, Thrushes and Blackbirds, have
been coming in at intervals, young birds first, and the old later in
the year. Unusually large flights of Fieldfares are recorded at inland
stations in December and January. Heligoland, Oct. 14th, first; 19th,
early, flights of hundreds; 29th, great many, also caught at night at
lighthouse; Nov. 22nd and 28th, great many; also Dec. 1st, 24th, and
30th (S.W. still overcast), on the latter day very large numbers.

_T. varius_, White Thrush.--Heligoland, Oct. 3rd, one caught; 23rd, one
seen (certain).

_T. migratorius_, Red-breasted Thrush.--Heligoland, Oct. 14th, N.W.,
windy and rain, one seen in cliff, quite close.

_T. merula_, Blackbird.--Spring, 1884: At the Northumberland stations
from March 14th to 20th, many, wind W. and S.W. Orfordness L.H., May
18th, 6 p.m., three struck. Autumn: Great Cotes, Sept. 12th, some young
cocks. At numerous stations between the Farn Islands and Hanois L.H.,
Guernsey, in October, and marvellous numbers in November with the like
lateral range; Nov. 11th, 12th, and 13th, an almost continuous rush
night and day, with S.E. winds and a low pressure area in Western
Europe.[28] Great Cotes, Nov. 26th, first old cocks with yellow bills.
Hasborough L.V., Jan. 19th and 20th, 1885, easterly winds, Blackbirds
all night. Farn L.H., Jan. 6th to 19th, several on island. Longstone
L.H., Jan. 4th, N., rain, passing to land. Migration much in excess of
previous reports. Heligoland, first, Oct. 11th, and at intervals to
Nov. 5th, up to which date no old cock had been seen; last on Nov. 10th
and 12th. The migration of this species at Heligoland is very light
compared with the English coast.

[Footnote 28: This rush appears to have, in a greater or less
degree, covered the whole of the east coast. At the Longstone L.H.,
Farn Islands, it is recorded by our observer, Mr. T. O. Hall, as
follows:--"Nov. 10th, all kinds of small birds coming all day, one
Snipe seen, wind southerly, hazy weather; at 8 a.m., three grey crows
to E. 11th, birds still coming, all kinds, or rather the small kind,
two Snipe, and one Woodcock. 12th, great rush of Blackbirds, Ouzel, a
few Mistletoe Thrushes., Redwings, Lapwings, Grey and Golden Plover, as
well as Woodcock and Snipe. This is the greatest rush of the season,
and lasted all day up to 10 p.m.; complete absence of Starlings; wind
all day from S. to S. by W., after midnight changing to N.W." There was
no corresponding rush across Heligoland during the same period.]

_T. torquatus_, Ring Ouzel.--Spring, 1884: Farn Islands, March 23rd
to 29th, a few. Autumn: first seen, Sept. 9th, Spurn, some. Redcar,
Oct. 24th to 26th, a few. Longstone L.H., Nov. 12th, rush. Migration
considerably under average. Heligoland, Sept. 16th, some; 17th,
sprinkling; 19th, pretty numerous; Oct. 11th, first old birds; last
observed, Nov. 22nd.

_Saxicola œnanthe_, Wheatear.--Spring, 1884: March 19th, Farn L.H.,
first. Hanois L.H., Guernsey, 28th and 30th, midnight, many round
lantern; April 7th, many during morning in two's and three's, to W.;
18th and 21st, the same. Farn Islands and Teesmouth, May 3rd to 17th,
many going S.E. to N.W. Autumn: Farn L.H., between August 6th first, to
Redcar, Oct. 26th last, great migration along the coast between these
dates, from north to south, both of home birds and others which had

then a considerable migration to the 22nd, when the movement for the
time ceased, commencing again on the 27th, and was continued through
September to the 19th; the first old birds on October 3rd, and again
some young on the 12th, when the passage appears to have ceased.

migration ceased; astounding numbers with others on the 14th and 15th
Sept.

_P. rubicola_, Stonechat.--Spurn, August 29th, considerable immigration
of young birds; Sept. 26th, many old. In North-east Lincolnshire we

bean-fields;[30] 27th, some. October, old birds very plentiful.

[Footnote 30: Bean-fields near the coast are always a very favourite
haunt in the early autumn of the soft-billed insect-feeders. I have
frequently at this season found such places swarming with various
Warblers, Wagtails, and Pipits, the situation affording the very best
cover as well as an abundance of food in the numerous insects and their
larvæ which infest the bean plant in its latter growth.]

astounding numbers; 14th, many; 15th, same; 21st to 25th, less; 30th,
some. This very well represents the general order of migration at
the island; first a few, then a rush for some days culminating in
astounding numbers, after which there is a gradual falling away till
the migration of that special species ceases altogether.

_Calcarius lapponicus_, Lapland Bunting.--Cley, Norfolk, Sept. 17th,
N.E., one, a young male, obtained by Mr. F. D. Power. Great Cotes,

Pigeons, which appear a smaller race than our home-bred birds. All this
time Snow Buntings, chiefly old birds. Tees L.V., Dec. 7th, 16th and
17th, large flocks to S.W. and N.W. Heligoland, Oct. 16th first; 29th,

year; enormous numbers crossed between the 14th and 25th of October,
especially on the 19th, "immense numbers;" 20th, "clouds of enormous
numbers;" 21st, "astounding;" 22nd, "astounding flights like clouds
passing on," and so on in less numbers to the end of the year.

_Pastor roseus_, Rose-coloured Pastor.--Aug. 30th, one shot near Spurn,
and another reputed to have been seen. Mr. Slater, who saw this bird,
says it was in very dusky plumage, and its colouring very much that of
an old Hooded Crow, but it was an adult female, and dissection showed
that it had bred this season.

_Corvus monedula_, Daw.--In large flocks at several stations in October
and November, frequently mixed with Rooks. Heligoland, first on October
6th; 12th, many; 15th, several flights; 24th and 25th, astounding
numbers.

_C. corone_, Carrion Crow.--Large numbers appear to have come over
in October. There are innumerable entries in the schedules of "black
crows" and "grey crows," and of course it is quite impossible to say
in each case whether Carrion Crows or Rooks are intended. In those
instances where the flocks are mixed, grey and black Crows together,
the latter are probably _C. corone_. Rooks, as a rule, keep to
themselves when migrating, or mixed with Jackdaws.

_C. cornix_, Hooded Crow.--Spring: Outer Dowsing L.V., March 1st, 8.30
a.m., flight to S.S.E. from W.N.W., and the same on April 3rd and 4th.
Farn L.H., April 11th, eleven to W. Great Cotes, May 8th, last. Autumn:
First at Flamborough L.H. on Oct. 3rd, two in field near lighthouse.
Thanet, 5th, one from N.E.; then on the 6th at Tees L.V., Flamborough,
Spurn, Hunstanton L.H. and Hasborough L.V., a few; during the latter
half of October the rush appears to have been continuous night and day;
and at the Outer Dowsing L.V., Nov. 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, a continuous
rush N.E. to S.W., and also at other stations, but in less numbers to
Nov. 15th; Redcar, Dec. 3rd, some; and Spurn, at intervals, a few to
end of the year; the main body came in from Flamborough Head to the
coast of Essex, comparatively few north of Flamborough or south of the
Thames; the chief lines of flight S.E. to N.W., E. to W., and S. to
N.W. Heligoland, Oct. 2nd, first flight; 5th and 6th, numbers; and on
to 14th, when thousands crossed; 15th, none; 18th, N., great flights;
19th less; 20th, great numbers; 21st, astounding numbers; less on 22nd
and 23rd, and then very great again on 24th and 25th; Nov. 1st, and on
2nd and 3rd, very great migration late in afternoon, and at intervals
to 28th.

_C. frugilegus_, Rook.--Spring: Newarp L.V., Feb. 10th to 13th and 22nd
to 23rd, 7.30 to 9 a.m., great numbers of "black crows" to eastward,
and at intervals to April; 23rd, large numbers of both black and grey
Crows in same direction; Larks, Sparrows, and Chaffinches also; at the
same date, Feb. 23rd, large numbers of Crows and Larks passing _to the
west_. Shipwash L.V., 13th, 8 a.m., flights of thousands to S.E. Leman
and Ower L.V., from March 4th and through April, great numbers of Crows
to E. from W. Autumn: Oct. 5th to Nov. 12th, recorded at nine stations
south of Humber, from Spurn to Orfordness; an almost continuous rush
night and day last fortnight in October. Heligoland, Oct. 6th, first;
14th, great numbers; 15th, some; 23rd, two monstrous flights in
afternoon; 24th and 25th, astounding numbers (see General Remarks);
Nov. 3rd, during afternoon.

_C. corax_, Raven.--Languard L.H., June 22nd, 6.50 a.m., two.

_Alauda arvensis_, Sky Lark.--Spring: At Leman and Ower L.V., March
4th, great many E. to W., also many birds, Chaffinches and others,
to April 9th, likewise E. to W. Outer Dowsing L.V., March 7th, Larks
and Starlings. In the autumn Larks are recorded first at the Varne
L.V., Sept. 6th; last at Goodwin L.V., Dec. 23rd, a few about lantern
all night; the migration covering 109 days, and including twenty-four
stations between the Farn Islands and Hanois L.H., fourteen of which
are light vessels. From Sept. 30th to the middle of Nov. enormous
numbers crossed the North Sea either directly from E. to W., a point S.
of E. to other N. of W., and from the 15th of Oct. to the end of the
month the rush appears to have been nearly continuous night and day;
the great rush from the 20th to the 23rd. At Heligoland the migration
commenced on the 22nd of Sept. with pretty large flights, and continued
at intervals to the end of the year; on the 21st October an enormous
migration over the sea on each side of the island; night of 24th to
25th, great rush, 500 caught at lighthouse.

_A. arborea_, Woodlark.--Heligoland, Oct. 6th, a few; also on 8th and
11th; 13th, twenty to thirty; 15th, some; 22nd and 30th, many; Nov.
2nd, some; and the 28th, many.

_A. cristata_, Crested Lark.--Heligoland, Sept. 30th and Oct. 1st, one
each day.

_Otocorys alpestris_, Shore Lark.--Yarmouth, Nov. 11th, two; 12th,
one. Blakeney, 28th, two. Spurn, two or three about the same date.
Heligoland, Oct. 2nd, first young; 6th, flights eight to ten; 7th, 8th,
and 9th, some flights; 12th, large flights; 14th, flights of hundreds;
15th and 16th, some; 18th, large flights, thirty to forty; 20th, in
afternoon, a flight, fifty to sixty; 21st, twenty to thirty; 24th,
great multitudes; 29th and 30th, less; Nov. 2nd and 3rd, many; 10th
and 11th, hundreds constantly, and at intervals to Dec. 1st in large
numbers. When we consider the very few which appear on this side of
the North Sea compared with the vast numbers passing Heligoland in the
autumn, it becomes a matter of surprise where they all go, and in what
lands they find winter-quarters.

_Cypselus apus_, Swift.--Spring: Hunstanton L.H., May 6th, two. Cromer
L.H., July 28th, 3 a.m., two struck lantern. Last seen, Thanet, Sept.

caught in a trap, baited with a Redshank it had killed. Rush, first
week in October and 11th. Tengmalm's Owl, _Nyctala tengmalmi_, Oct.
18th, one shot at Holmpton, Holderness ['Naturalist,' 1884, p. 110].
Heligoland, _A. brachyotus_, Sept. 21st, first; Oct. 3rd, 11th, 14th,
some; very few compared with other years. _N. tengmalmi_, Oct. 3rd, one
shot; 7th, one.

Falconidæ, Buteo.--First fortnight in September, a few "large Hawks"
along coast, some of which would probably be Buzzards. Goshawk, _Astur
palumbarius_, Sept. 29th, one seen on the wing by me, when driving
between Easington and Skeflling, Holderness. Sparrowhawk, _A. nisus_,
Spring: Newarp L.V., April 23rd, two, to E. Autumn: Dudgeon L.V., Aug.

first fortnight in September. Peregrine Falcon, _Falco peregrinus_,
Spurn, Sept. 9th, one, in pursuit of a Tern; Oct. 2nd, 8 p.m., one,

seen, and on 10th, ten in one field, by the Rev. H. H. Slater. Very
common in North-east Lincolnshire in September. Thanet, Sept. 12th to

vulgaris_, Buzzard, Sept. 4th and 5th, some. _Archibuteo lagopus_,
Rough-legged Buzzard, Sept. 15th, one shot; Nov. 10th, several small

_Sula bassana_, Gannet.--Farn L.H., March 7th, several all day to N.E.;
10th, the same, and hundreds all day on 15th and 16th April. Longstone
L.H., March 16th, some at 5 p.m., to north, and daily to 26th all day,
but no large flocks, and more or less daily to April 15th. Autumn: Farn
L.H., July 2nd, first young seen. Redcar, Sept. 24th to end of month,
very numerous at sea, mainly young.

_Ardea cinerea_, Heron.--At many stations in the autumn, but it
is impossible to say whether immigrants or not. Herons have been
very common in the autumn and winter in all the low-lying districts
in North-east Lincolnshire. On the evening of February 3rd, 1885,
fourteen, flying close together, passed over me within half-gunshot,
steering their course in the direction of the nearest "beck."

_Botaurus stellaris_, Bittern.--One shot in Gedney Marsh on Nov. 14th;
one in Yorkshire, four or five in Lincolnshire, one in Norfolk, and
one in Suffolk, during the first week in December, and one near Brigg,
Lincolnshire, in January, 1885. Snow and severe frosts on Continent
from Nov. 28th to Dec. 2nd. It is probable that the bulk of these
visitors were shot within a week of their arrival on our shores.

_Platalea leucorodia_, Spoonbill.--Hollesley, Suffolk, four, early in
August, two of which were shot by a "fortunate" gunner. ['Zool.,' 1884,
p. 471.]

Anser, Geese.--Spring: Whitby, May 8th, eighteen wild geese, from N.
to S. Autumn: first recorded from Whitby L.H., Sept. 8th, three large
flocks to S., flying half a mile from shore. The main arrival from
Redcar to Humber district on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Oct. Coquet L.H.,
Nov. 4th, many flocks all day to N. Shipwash L.V., Dec. 1st and 2nd,
nights to W. Heligoland, _Anser cinereus_, Grey-lag Goose, Oct. 10th, a
flight, one shot, a young bird; 11th, some; Nov. 30th, numerous.

A black Swan was shot on Sunk Island [Humber] in the autumn. Redcar,
Oct. 5th, nine to N. Yarmouth, Nov. 20th, four on Breydon Water. Corton
L.V., Dec. 4th and 6th, two.

_Tadorna cornuta_, Sheldrake.--Spring: April 12th, Farn L.H., four on
rocks; first young at sea on June 22nd. Twigmoor, Lincolnshire, May
23rd, pair of old birds and seven young on pond. Redcar, Dec. 3rd,
flock. Farn L.H., Jan. 21st, 10.30 to noon, flocks to N., one flock
numbering thirty-eight.

_Mareca penelope_, Wigeon.--Redcar, Oct. 28th, first seen, several.

_Anas boschas_, Wild Duck.--Spring: Outer Dowsing L.V., March 9th, 9
to 3 p.m., Wild Ducks continuous, from N.W. to S.E. Autumn: Redcar,
October 3rd to December 6th., large numbers in various directions, also
at most coast stations. Heligoland, _Querquedula crecca_, Teal, Sept.
1st, great many, also 2nd and 3rd.

_Harelda glacialis_, Long-tailed Duck.--Farn L.H., Jan. 12th, 1885,
several swimming all day near island.

_Somateria mollissima_, Eider Duck.--Spring: Coquet L.H., April 28th,
twenty, of which four were males off island. May 8th, many Ducks and
Drakes, and at the same station in December many off island. Farn L.H.,
Jan. 11th and 12th, 1885, hundreds swimming in lee of island. The first
young were seen on June 13th. The King Eider, _Somateria spectabilis_,
was seen at the Farn Islands on April 9th, and at the Longstone on May
4th. This bird, which has now regularly appeared in the locality for
several years, was unfortunately shot at on June 12th, and was not seen
afterwards.

_Œdemia nigra_, Common Scoter.--Gull L.V., April 27th, 8 a.m. to noon,
continuous to N. Autumn: Great numbers at several stations, moving in
various directions.

_Mergus merganser_, Goosander.--Redcar, Oct. 6th, one to N.W.; Nov.
19th, flock; Dec. 8th, two. _M. serrator_, Merganser, a few observed
off Redcar at sea between Oct. 12th and 25th.

_Columba palumbus_, Ring Dove.--Orfordness, Sept. 27th, 9 p.m., one
struck, killed. Languard, 29th, 8 a.m., eight flying very quick
W. to N.E. Between 21st of October and the end of November there
was an immense immigration covering the East Coast between Berwick
and Yarmouth; rushes Oct. 21st to 25th, Nov. 2nd and 20th to 28th,
continuous for nine days. Mr. T. H. Nelson says "there was an enormous
arrival of these birds in the Redcar neighbourhood about the middle
of November. I have not noted all down in the schedule, as I did
not see them all myself, but am told that from the 20th to end of
month there was a continuous migration; a friend shot about fifty in
three days between Redcar and Marske; there was also a considerable
influx into the Bishop Auckland district about the same time." In
Northumberland the numbers were so large as to attract general
attention. In Lincolnshire the arrival was immense, also on the Norfolk
coast. Hundreds were shot on their first arrival, their crops and
stomachs containing no food, invariably the case with all newly arrived
migrants. Heligoland, Oct. 3rd, flight of sixty; 12th, some; 25th,
great many, twenty to thirty in a flight.

_C. ænas_, Stockdove.--Great numbers crossed in the autumn with the
ring doves, mixed or in separate flocks. In November I saw one flock
of four or five hundred in the Great Cotes marshes, an enormous flight
considering the limited number bred in the district. From the beginning
of December to the end of February large flights have daily resorted
to fields of young clover, or those recently laid down with permanent
grasses.

_Turtur communis_, Turtle Dove.--Thanet, Oct. 4th, last seen.

Rallidæ, _Rallus aquaticus_, Water Rail.--There appears to have been
a very considerable immigration between the third week in September
and at intervals to the end of November, and through the autumn they
were exceedingly plentiful in all likely localities on the East Coast.
Heligoland, Oct. 25th, some; 30th, two or three. _Porzana maruetta_,
Spotted Crake. Redcar, Sept. 2nd, one. Heligoland, Oct. 23rd, one.
_Crex pratensis_, Corn Crake. Spring: Whitby, May 2nd, W.S.W., 3 a.m.,
first heard. Autumn: Great Cotes, Sept. 4th; and last near Spurn, Oct.
27th and 28th, one each day. _Gallinula chloropus_, Moorhen, Great
Cotes, Nov. 18th, N. strong, sleet and rain, great numbers on the
streams, drains, and "blowwell" ponds, also in gardens and localities
where I have rarely seen them; probably altogether ten to one in excess
of normal numbers; very few observed after this date. Heligoland, Oct.
23rd, some.

_Charadrius pluvialis_, Golden Plover.--Spring: Longstone L.H., March
14th, S., with Lapwings round lantern. Farn L.H., July 27th, first
flock. Tees L.V., Aug. 25th, large flock to N.W.[31] Great Cotes, the
great flight of old birds on 25th and 26th Nov. Heligoland, Aug. 1st to
3rd, N.N.W., numerous; 5th to 25th, daily, some young; 31st, 11 p.m.,
many; Sept. 23rd, still many; Oct. 12th, some; Nov. 30th, old birds.

[Footnote 31: See footnote Report for 1883, p. 50, on the night of
Golden Plover northward in August.]

_Squatarola helvetica_, Grey Plover. Spurn, Aug. 24th, about twenty
adults in summer plumage; Sept. 5th, about one hundred and fifty, of
which a third were in summer plumage, probably all adults (H. H. S.).
Cley and Blakeney, Sept. 5th, several, the first seen (F. D. P.)

_Ægialitis hiaticula_, Ringed Plover.--Spring: Spurn, April 19th, nest
with four eggs. Longstone L.H., May 4th, nest with four eggs. Very
numerous on migration at Spurn, Aug. 20th to Sept. 10th, there was a
small ploughed field on which probably a thousand collected every night
(H. H. S.). Heligoland, June 28th, several hundreds young. _Ægialitis
cantiana_, Kentish Plover. Languard L.H., Aug. 12th, one.

_Eudromias morinellus_, Dotterel.--Spring, Great Cotes, May 8th, seven.
Autumn: Cley and Blakeney, Sept. 5th, W.N.W., five, one alone showing
some rufous on lower, parts of breast and flanks (F. D. P.). Easington,
near Spurn, Oct. 11th and 13th, seven. Heligoland, August 31st, some.

_Vanellus vulgaris_, Lapwing.--Great flights on to the coast throughout
October to Nov. 12th. Rushes, Coquet L.H., Oct. 8th, great numbers
all day; Redcar, 25th, continuous to N.W.; Tees L.V., 22nd and 23rd,
large flights to N.W.; and in November at Redcar on the 1st and 3rd
throughout the morning; 5th, all day; 8th, same. Hasboro' L.V., 12th,
10 p.m. to sunrise on 13th, and Jan. 3rd, 1885, night, quantities
round lantern. Heligoland, July 27th to 28th, great numbers, and to
Aug. 25th, daily.

_Strepsilas interpres_, Turnstone.--Farn, Aug. 13th, S.S.W., hundreds
in flocks all day. Spurn, Aug. 20th to Sept. 10th, plentiful and
increasing in numbers.

_Himantopus ostralegus_, Oystercatcher.--Spurn, Aug. 20th to Sept.
10th, a few at intervals.

_Phalaropus fulicarius_, Grey Phalarope.--Felixstowe, Sept. 9th, one
shot. Longstone L.H., Nov. 2nd, one swimming in pool near lighthouse.

_Scolopax rusticula_, Woodcock.--Spring: Spurn, March 15th, one. Farn
Islands, 25th, one; and again on April 28th. At Twigmoor, Lincolnshire,
young Woodcocks were hatched early in May.[32] Autumn: The first is
recorded at Coquet L.H. on Sept. 1st; the last at Hasboro' L.V., Jan.
20th, 1885, one caught at night. The migration covered 142 days, the
bulk arriving between Oct. the 5th and Nov. 22nd. What is usually
termed by sportsmen the 'first flight' came in on the nights of the 5th
and 6th of October, wind easterly; another flight between the 10th and
16th; the 'great flight' on the night of the 28th, N.W. strong, with
rain and colder weather; on the 29th, forty were shot in one locality
on the Lincolnshire coast; there was again a second "great flight" from
the 11th to 13th of November. Independent of these rushes, Woodcocks
have been dropping in either singly or by two's and three's throughout
the last three months in the year, and more or less over the whole
coast line. Altogether the migration has been much more desultory and
prolonged than any previously recorded by us. Heligoland, Oct. 6th,
some; 12th, some; 14th, twenty shot; 15th, about thirty shot; 19th,
less; 23rd, some; 25th, twenty to thirty shot; 29th, forty to fifty on
island--night, about ten caught at lighthouse; 30th, thirty to forty
caught or shot; Nov. 1st, some; 3rd, full moon, numbers flying about
island, two or three together; 12th, ten or twelve shot; 16th, ten or
fifteen shot; 22nd, several; 28th, twenty shot and two caught; 30th,
some; Dec. 26th, one.

[Footnote 32: Woodcocks bred in Great Britain invariably leave in the
autumn in August and September, and their place is taken some weeks
later by others coming from the north. Woodcocks found on the East
Coast in March are either such as have wintered in these islands and
are now on their return journey, or in some cases our English birds
returning to their nesting haunts.]

Snipe, _Gallinago major_, Great Snipe. Farn, Aug. 31st, 5 a.m., calm,
one to W. Cley and Blakeney, Sept. 15th, E., one shot. _G. cœlestis_,
Common Snipe, Kentish Knock L.V., Sept. 9th, several about, one
caught, were passing W. Cley and Blakeney, Sept. 16th, a considerable
arrival. There was a very considerable rush on to the East Coast in
the last fortnight in October, and again in November, from the Farn
Islands to Yarmouth; three distinct rushes at the dates Nov. 4th to
5th, S.W., half gale; 10th to 14th, S.E. winds; and 23rd to 29th,
N. and north-easterly winds; generally are reported to have been
very plentiful in the Eastern Counties in November and December.
_Limnocryptes gallinula_, Jack Snipe, very few records; the first July
31st, Farn L.H., one at noon to W.; a few at Great Cotes and Spurn last
half of October. In recent years this little bird has become extremely
scarce in the Humber district, and in localities where it was once very
common; compared with former times--twenty years ago--I do not see one
in ten now. Heligoland, Common Snipe and Jack Snipe, Oct. 17th, N.W.,
strong, some; 25th and 30th, some.

_Tringa alpina_, Dunlin.--Spurn, Aug. 20th to Sept. 10th, great many,
some flocks containing thousands, and in August many in almost full
summer plumage (H. H. S.) Near Kilnsea, Sept. 26th, at early morning, I
saw an immense migratory flock on the beach which appeared very tired;
many of these still retained the black pectoral patch entire or more or
less broken. Great Cotes, a flight of 1000 to 1500 have resorted almost
daily at high-water, throughout the winter, to a fallow field near the
Humber.

_T. minuta_, Little Stint.--Blakeney and Cley, Sept. 5th, W.N.W., two,
and one Temminck's stint; also, Sept. 12th, E. to N., one Temminck's
Stint, very restless, and constantly uttering its queer cricket-like
notes (F. D. P.). Spurn, Sept. 26th, four Little Stints.

_T. striata_, Purple Sandpiper.--Spring: Farn, March 28th, many all
day on rocks. Autumn: Redcar, Oct. 16th, one; and 20th, four shot.
Blakeney, third week in October, one. Heligoland, Sept. 11th, E.S.E.
some.

_T. canutus_, Knot.--Redcar, July 23rd, S.W., first flock; Aug. 6th,
S. to S.W., a few. Spurn, Aug. 20th to Sept. 10th, tolerably numerous,
some examples obtained were in almost full summer plumage; Sept. 26th
and forward through Nov., great many large flights at ebb tide crossing
from Lincolnshire coast to Spurn muds. Heligoland, enormous numbers of
Waders crossed Heligoland from the end of the third week in July to the
middle of September; July 20th, night, enormous numbers to W.; 22nd,
same; 22nd to 23rd, night, and to 25th, immense numbers; Sept. 16th,
flight of _tringa_, _totanus_, _charadrius_, all young.

_T. subarquata_, Curlew Sandpiper. Thanet, Aug. 16th, five. Spurn,

black-backed Gulls continuously to south; they passed the cliff point
to the north of Easington lane end at the average rate of seventy
in fifteen minutes; the exact proportion of old and young in that
period was nineteen adult and forty-eight immature Lesser black-backed
Gulls, one Kittiwake, and two Terns; occasionally a few young Herring
Gulls passed, but the vast majority were immature _L. fuscus_. On the
average, 280 Gulls passed in the hour, all going south in the teeth of
a strong S.W. wind; rate of progress probably thirty miles an hour, and
average distance from coast 150 yards. This movement was continuous
for at least four days, and for ten hours on each day. Cromer, Oct.
11th, Mr. Gurney writes "We have had another of those strange passages
of Gulls which I have noticed at Cromer before. I reckoned that this
afternoon eighteen hundred passed in three-quarters of an hour, going
W.N.W., and probably ten thousand after 12 o'clock." Redcar, Oct. 20th

young shot.

Alcidæ, Auks.--Longstone L.H., Feb. 20th. Guillemot (_Lomvia troile_),
flying about breeding-places, but not settling; on March 22nd they
settled for the first time; but on the 26th, owing to the cold E.
wind, all went out to sea, returning again to the rocks on the 29th
with a W. and S.W. wind. Farn L.H. March 16th, hundreds flying round
nesting-quarters. Tees L.V., July 2nd, "a Guillemot came to the
light-ship and remained three weeks, disappeared suddenly, probably
shot." Redcar, Nov. 12th to 15th, great numbers to E. all day; Nov.
10th, Black Guillemot (_U. grylle_), young bird shot. Longstone L.H.,
April 17th, Puffin (_Fratercula arctica_), first seen. Redcar, Nov.
18th, 19th, 20th, Little Auk (_Mergulus alle_), great numbers at
sea. Farn Islands, Jan. 12th to 26th, 1885, great many off islands.
Heligoland, Nov. 13th, cliff crowded with Guillemots, never so early
before; Dec. 17th, W., thousands on cliffs, as in summer time.

Professor Chr. Fr. Lütken, of the Universitetets Zoologiske Museum,
Copenhagen, again forwards a list of birds killed against the
lighthouse of Stevns, on the projecting part of Zealand, marking the
limit between the Baltic and Oresund. The list has been drawn up by Mr.
Autander, a physician living in the neighbourhood of the lighthouse.
In forwarding the list, Mr. Autander observes that he has every reason
to think it very incomplete, as the interest bestowed upon it by the
officers of the lighthouse is rather indifferent; all birds fit to be
eaten are probably disposed of in this way, and do not always come
under his observation.

Notes on Insects at the Lighthouses.

Under date of June 30th, Mr. Owen Boyle, of the Languard L.H., reports,
"a Sky Lark followed by a string of Bees. The plaintive cries of this
poor bird first attracted my attention, it flew so close that I almost
caught it; it was closely pursued by a large number of Bees, and in
its fright took to the water followed by its pursuers. When last seen
it was making for the Essex coast." July 31st, at 10.14 a.m., "a cloud
of mosquitoes pitched in this neighbourhood, similar to those seen in
India; most of them were carried off at noon by a light breeze."

Mr. Charles Williams, of the Hanois L.H., Guernsey, says, under date of
July 10th, "A great quantity of large ants with wings passing. A great
many settled on the rocks and about the lighthouse. I have only once
seen them before like this, when I was stationed at the South Bishop
Rock off the coast of Wales."

Heligoland, by Mr. Gätke.--Night, July 2nd to 3rd, thousands of _Plusia
gamma_; 3rd, myriads of Dragonflies; night, 21st to 22nd, great numbers
of _Bombyx neustria_, east to west; 22nd to 23rd, the same; 27th to
28th, numerous nights passing on.


General Remarks.

The report for the East Coast of England shows that a great migration
was carried on for six months in the autumn and winter of 1884-5. The
schedules returned indicate that no one place had special preference,
and that the inflow of migrants was equally distributed over the entire
coast line.

The southerly movement of migrants was well established in July, and
from this time to the end of the third week in January, 1885, there
has been a steady flow, with slight intermissions, of birds either
passing up the coast to the south or moving directly inland, the vast
majority coming from the east across the North Sea, and moving westward
or in westerly directions. Occasionally there have been heavy rushes or
persistent bird waves continuous for days, and even weeks.

The periods of migration occupied by different species vary greatly,
from four weeks to as many months; no general rule can be laid down in
this respect.

As a rule, the young birds of the year migrate independently of the
old, and some weeks in advance; there are, however, frequent exceptions
to this, more especially late in the season, when the flocks are
sometimes composed of old and young. With some of our shore birds,
as Grey Plover, Knot, Sanderling, a few old birds, still in summer
plumage, arrive very early in the season, some weeks later the main
body of the young, and lastly the bulk of the adults, the latter having
then assumed the ordinary winter dress.

The lines of migration have been those followed in previous years, the
vast majority of immigrants coming either directly from east to west or
from points south of east to others north of west. The records of birds
travelling from points north of east are comparatively exceptional.

There was an immense and continuous rush, a gigantic feathery tide, on
to the coast from the middle of October (15th) to the end of the month,
migrants arriving continuously night and day. This rush was continued
at some of the stations with but slight intermissions to the middle of
November. The last fortnight in October is the average annual period
of what may be called the "great rush" of immigrants on to the East
Coast of England.

In previous reports we have drawn attention to the fact of a migration
in opposite directions going on at the same time over the North Sea.
This is observed more particularly at southeastern stations, on light
vessels moored at many miles distance from the nearest land, where,
during the spring and autumn, the same species of birds, as Crows,
Rooks, Jackdaws, Starlings, Larks, Sparrows, Buntings and Finches,
are recorded crossing the North Sea moving from opposite quarters and
passing both towards the British coast and towards the Continent. This
apparently abnormal movement in opposite directions is again indicated
in the autumn and spring of 1884-5.

In a recent article in the 'Encyclopædia Britannica,' Professor Newton
tells us that "there is scarcely a bird of either the Palæarctic or
Nearctic regions, whose habits are at all well known, of which much
the same may not be said; and hence we are led to the conclusion
that every bird of the Northern Hemisphere is, to a greater or less
degree, migratory in some part or other of its range." There can be
no doubt that in this passage Professor Newton indicates the probable
explanation of the special phenomena attending a double migration as
recorded from time to time in our reports.

With very few exceptions, the vast majority of our British birds, such
as are generally considered habitual residents, the young invariably,
the old intermittingly, leave these islands in the autumn, their
place being taken by others, not always necessarily of the same
species, coming from more northern latitudes, or from districts of
Eastern Europe, where, on the approach of winter, the conditions of
locality and food-supply are found less favourable to existence.
These immigrants on the approach of spring leave, moving back to the
Continent on the same lines, but in the reverse direction to those
traversed in the autumn; at the same time, also, our own birds return
from the Continent to their nesting-quarters in these islands. To
give one instance, out of many which might be cited, that of the
Blackbird:--In the autumn, during September, the young of the year
leave their summer-quarters, and their place is shortly taken by
others, likewise young birds, coming in October and November from
districts which lie directly east or south-east of Great Britain.
Should our English winter prove generally severe, or even partially so,
our old birds will also leave, and in their place we have an influx of
old Blackbirds from the Continent, pushed forward by similar causes.
In the last autumn and winter, which has been exceedingly variable,
with many sudden changes of temperature, our East Coast reports show an
enormous migration of this species to have taken place. This commenced
on September 12th, and was continued at intervals throughout October,
becoming nearly continuous in November; after this intermittent, in
throbs and pulsations, up to the end of the third week in January,
1885. These influxes of old birds correlate with sudden changes of
temperature and outbreaks of severe weather on the Continent. In the
spring the continental visitors disappear, and our so-called resident
Blackbirds come back to their nesting-quarters. In this way we have
a regular interchange of birds in the spring and autumn,--a double
migration, carried on twice a year between the British Islands and the
Continent. As far as our knowledge extends the normal conditions of
locality and climate over the whole area are such as do not necessitate
a regular interchange of the members of their respective _avi-faunas_.
There is apparently no reason why our Rooks, Starlings, Sky Larks, and
Blackbirds should not be able to winter in England just as well as
abroad; their not doing so, but persistently migrating, is suggestive
of a regular succession of bird waves,--as one moves forward another
quickly follows in its wake. The southern limit of autumn migration,
in the individuals of any species, is in direct ratio to the breeding
range; such as nest in southern latitudes move still further south, and
thus make room for those of their sort which have nested further north.
Such are the ordinary phenomena of migration, a movement which is as
regular and persistent as the flow and ebb of the tide.[33]

[Footnote 33: Migration is a voluntary, and not a compulsory, movement;
and it must not be imagined that recurring bird waves actually push
each other forward. Young Blackbirds and Thrushes leave some weeks
in advance of the great rush of their continental allies; and it is
well known that Woodcocks, which breed in Great Britain, leave in the
autumn, before the arrival of the northern flights, a distinct interval
elapsing between the two events--the going and the coming.]

One of the last schedules received, at the time of going to press,
from the Cockle L.V., off the Norfolk coast, records immense flights
of Crows (probably Rooks), passing in a southeasterly direction to the
Continent early in March, 1885, commencing on the 2nd at 7 a.m., in
large numbers on the 6th at 6 a.m., and continuous from 6 a.m. to 8
a.m. on the 8th; large numbers again on the 9th at 5.30 a.m.

The notes under the head of separate species in the East Coast report
for 1884, indicate several movements of special interest. Blackbirds,
as has been already stated, have crossed the North Sea in extraordinary
numbers, commencing on September 12th and throughout October, and
immense numbers in November; on the 11th, 12th and 13th the rush
appears to have been continuous, night, and day, over the whole coast
line; after this intermittent to the end of the third week in January,
1885.

Another very interesting feature is the occurrence of the Arctic
Bluethroat in considerable numbers between September 8th and 16th;
eighty to one hundred were observed in one locality on the Norfolk
coast on the 12th.

The migration of the Gold-crested Wren was very pronounced. The first
are recorded on August 28th, and after this at various stations in
large numbers up to November 22nd. Eighty-seven days against ninety-two
in 1882, and eighty-two in 1883. The visible migration of this little
wanderer across Heligoland has been considerably below the average of
other years.

Pied Flycatchers arrived in large numbers from August 10th to September
17th. Across Heligoland also there was a great migration between August
10th and September 18th.

Immense numbers of Bing Doves are shown to have crossed from the
Continent between the 21st of October and the end of November. This
immigration appears to have covered the coast between Berwick and
Yarmouth. On our northern coasts for nine days, between November the
20th and 28th, the rush was continuous. Large numbers of Stock Doves
also crossed during the same period.

The main body of the Woodcocks generally arrive in two flights, known
to East-coast sportsmen as the "first flight," and after this the
"great flight." In the autumn of 1884 the immigration of this species
was most prolonged, commencing on September 1st, and continued onward
to January 20th, 1885, or 142 days. Four distinct rushes or flights are
also indicated,--October 5th and 6th; another on the 10th to the 16th;
a third, probably the "great flight," on the 28th; and again a very
large flight between November the 11th and 13th. Independent of these
there has been a constant dropping in by two or three together, or
singly, throughout the autumn and winter. Woodcocks have also crossed
Heligoland in the same desultory fashion; and the dates of the chief
flights will be found to correlate closely with the rushes on to our
East Coast.

In the latter part of November and early in December there was a
considerable arrival of Bitterns on the East Coast, probably driven
across by the severe weather on the Continent between November the 28th
and December 2nd.

Besides the Bluethroats, already noticed, several rare and casual
visitants have been recorded during the autumn. Two examples of the
Barred Warbler, one at Spurn Point and another on the Norfolk coast.
The Icterine Warbler, also on the Norfolk coast; and an Ortolan
Bunting, likewise from the same locality. The Lapland Bunting, in
Lincolnshire and Norfolk; Tengmalm's Owl, in Holderness; and a
rose-coloured Starling, near Spurn.

Mr. Gätke's Heligoland notes, from June 28th to the end of the year,
comprise 118 species, including, as usual, several rare visitors to
the ornithological observatory:--Icterine Warblers on Aug. 18th;
_Anthus richardi_, Sept. 3rd to Oct. 12th; _A. campestris_, Sept. 4th;
_Carpodacus erythrinus_, Sept. 9th; _Anthus cervinus_, a great many,
from Sept. 15th to Oct. 12th; _Lanius major_, in most unusual numbers,
from Sept. 17th to Nov. 4th; _Alauda cristata_, Sept. 30th and Oct.
1st; _Saxicola stapazina_ (?), Oct. 2nd; _Turdus varius_, Oct. 3rd,
12th and 23rd, one each day; _Emberiza pusilla_, Oct. 5th, two; _Turdus
migratorius_, one on Oct. 14th; _Fringilla rufescens_, our English
Redpoll, one on Nov. 22nd. Besides these large numbers of continental
species, which are classed amongst the rare and occasional visitants
to the British Islands, and whose line of migration is normally far
to eastward of these islands, as _Emberiza hortulana_, _Motacilla
flava_, _M. alba_, _Sylvia suecica_, _Anthus rupestris_, _Calcarius
lapponicus_, _Otocorys alpestris_, _Nyctala tengmalmi_, _Ruticilla
titys_, _Regulus ignicapillus_, and _Larus minutus_.

The great rush of birds crossed Heligoland during the last fortnight
in October, and appears to have come directly across to our eastern
shores. Mr. Gätke remarks, under date Oct. 24th, S.E., clear, fine,
early rather cold, _C. cornix_, _frugilegus_, and _monedula_, monstrous
numbers; _cornix_ and _monedula_ mixed in uninterrupted flight of ten
and twelve minutes each, continued with but short interruptions or
gaps; width as far as the eye could reach in northerly and southerly
directions; and thus from 9 a.m. till 1 p.m. _Sturnus_, "a succession
of clouds sweeping past overhead."

Speaking generally of migration during the month of October, "weather
exceptionally fine; nearly no _curruca_; very few _rufa_; few
_rubecula_, _accentor_, _regulus_; and _fringilla_ but small numbers.
Thrushes the same; not a single _Parus major_ nor other Tits; Pipits
also far below the usual numbers."

"Marvellously many _Anthus cervinus_, _Lanius major_ and _excubitor_,
and particularly _Corvidæ_ and Starlings. In December, Greenfinches,
enormous numbers all the month, more than ever been seen here."

Since the completion of the Report Mr. J. H. Gurney informs me that he
has received from Mr. J. Barrett, of the Swin Middle L.V., the wing
of a Garganey Teal with the date July 22nd, 1884. Dunlin, March 21st,
1885, and that of a Wheatear with the extraordinary date of Feb. 4th
attached.

From the Dudgeon L.V. comes a schedule signed by Mr. T. W. Harrison,
the entries ranging from Nov. 10th, 1884, to March 6th, 1885. On Nov.
10th about forty Carrion Crows going from S.E. to N.W.; considerable
numbers of Larks on the nights of the 11th and 12th, about twenty
being killed; on the 13th, two Woodcocks at 6.40 p.m., N.N.E. 3,
misty, one killed; the same night a great rush of Larks, Blackbirds,
Fieldfares and Starlings; "Black Crows" and Larks, also a few Thrushes,
at intervals through January, all coming from easterly and going in
westerly directions. On the night of Feb. 15th, E., Knot, Stint,
Lapwing and other birds round the lantern all night. Night of March
4th, E.S.E., Lapwings and Starlings about lantern, and eight of the
latter killed; on the night of the 5th, several Carrion Crows between 7
and 12 p.m., three killed. The Dudgeon L.V. is about thirty-five miles
east of Skegness on the Lincolnshire coast.




WEST COAST OF SCOTLAND.


Schedules were sent to thirty-four stations as before. We have received
returns from fifteen.

Generally the returns are as well filled up as in previous years.

We have notes on about thirty-one species of land birds from this
coast; about sixteen species of water birds; and of a few species of
littoral or wading birds.

I have kept the spring and autumn movements distinct.

In the following list of stations we indicate the numbers of years in
which each station has sent in returns, and the consecutive numbers of
the stations, in the same way, and for the same reasons, that we have
shown those in the report of the East Coast, and we also indicate the
value and brilliancy of the lights at each.

Notes from the Stations.[34]

[Footnote 34: Only the notable events, or anything of particular
interest, are here taken notice of. Such may be useful for faunal
purposes.]

Mr. Morrison, at Cape Wrath, Bays birds are scarce at this station: the
coast being so wild they keep more inland. Gamuts frequent the coast
all the year from February to November. The Peregrine Falcon is on the
coast almost all the year.

From Stoir Head Mr. Wither sends a few notes on land birds. Arrival
of Swallow noted May 11th, rather an early date for the West Coast of
Sutherland. Gannets were passing north continuously in August.

Mr. Youngclause, after a long residence on the Monach Isles, has
removed to an E. Coast station, but sends a last schedule from the
former, dating March 30th to April 7th. Wrens seem scarce here, and the
Goldcrest he saw this year, but never on any previous occasion. A robin
had not been seen before for ten years until April 7th, 1884. Snow
Buntings on April 4th are noted as unusual.

Mr. Youngclause adds "There has been a great scarcity of birds at this
station for a number of years back, and unless the winds happen to
be off the mainland, with hazy weather at the time of migration, we
scarcely see a bird. Even Eider Ducks have deserted this place of late
years, ever since we had the fearful storm of Nov. 15th, 1877, but I
am told they have been very abundant about the Sound of Barra, and the
sheltered places on the east side of the island."

Mr. William Irvine sends two interesting schedules from Barra Head. In
September a continuous flight of birds flying east is noticed on 6th,
light S.E. wind.

From Rona Lighthouse the Goldcrest, a single bird, is recorded in
October as unusual, and is accurately described; evidently of rare
occurrence here.

I have to thank Mr. McCulloch, Kyleakin, for the careful attention he
has given to the subject of direction of flight in every instance of a
record, and, I may add, I am pleased to find much more attention paid
throughout the 1884 records to this important item of our inquiries.

_Skerryvore._--Mr. Thomas Dawson sends full schedules from February
to December, but remarks, "Not one bird seen here between Dec. 1st and
Jan. 15th, date of latest schedule." The only evidence of rushes was
that of _Turdidæ_, in November, correlating with E. coast rushes, but
there are many light entries. The same gale which detained a Blackbird
on the rock also detained Mr. Crow, the under light-keeper, twelve
days after time at Hynish Signal Tower. He and the Blackbird changed
residence on the same date.

_Dhuheartach._--Numerous light entries also from this station, dating
Dec. 2nd, by Mr. William Davidson.

_Sound of Mull._--Mr. William McLellan pays careful attention to the
directions of flight, and set of the tides and movements of birds in
connection therewith.

_Rhuvaal._--Mr. George Boreham also notes these important particulars,
and takes note of the rainfall in August--3rd to 25th--a new feature
in our reports. He adds, "It is only very rarely a bird strikes our
lantern, as they keep well off shore when passing on the wing."

_M'Arthur's Head._--Evidences of a rush of migrants, of many species,
are given in Oct. 7th, 8th, 9th, by Mr. W. Mail. Wind prevailing S.W.,
but an E. gale on 9th, when "great numbers" are recorded.

_Skervuile._--Mr. John Ewing sends well-filled schedules dating Jan.
13th to Nov. 19th, giving many directions of flight. A curious and
interesting note is added. "On Oct. 5th" a "Sandpiper" occurs. "This
bird came to the rock five years ago, when I succeeded in taming it,
but I have not seen it since that time till now."

_Rhinns of Islay._--Mr. Peter Anderson makes a very good proposal
indeed, and that is that our Committee ask the cooperation of
assistants as well as principals, as "by so doing you will have a far
better chance to get more notes; because, as at present assistants care
very little about recording their operations, as they get no credit for
doing so, whilst they have one-half of the night on duty." Mr. Anderson
anxiously desires a "small book of plates of birds," and complains of
the confusion connected with local names in different parts. I have
urged, and still urge, on our Committee the advantage there would be
in a printed list of local names. For Scotland, the MS. is ready in
my hands to be made useful as it stands, and there is abundant room
for enlargement; but it would cost somewhat to print and distribute
it. I have three excellent schedules from Mr. Anderson. I think his
proposals are worthy of the attention both of our Committee and of the
British Association. Mr. Ross has also materially assisted Mr. Anderson
in filling these up. We would be glad to receive from all stations
the names of _all the assistant keepers_, which can be inserted in
next return of schedules. A very pronounced rush is recorded at this
station. It is quite a principal station on our W. coast.

_Lamlash, Arran._--Mr. David M. Scott does not consider it necessary
to mention all occurrences of Herons at this station, "as they breed
on the high rocks on the Island, and, of course, are always in the
locality."

_Turnberry._--From February to December almost all records are
accompanied by winds from S.S.E., S. or E. We have records on
twenty-one dates in that time, and only on one day (Nov. 19th) is the
wind out of another quarter, _viz._ N.N.W.; on this date a solitary
Redshank was killed at the lantern.

_Corsewall._--Rushes evident both in spring and autumn. Winds on dates
of heaviest records S. to E. and N.E., but also heavy returns on Sept.
22nd, with fresh S.W. and haze. Dates of rushes very marked. A short
but largely bulking schedule.

_Mull of Galloway._--The migration is, on the whole, more distinctly
shown in October on the West Coast south of the Clyde than on the East
Coast at Isle of May during October. The direction of flight usually
given is, where noticed, S.E. While on the East Coast, at Isle of May,
winds were north of either E. or W. between Sept. 26th and Oct. 17th,
on the West Coast south of Clyde they were S. and W. light. The coast
lines in the W. thus showed their influence on the migration; and the
normal winds, being west on the West Coast, developed a larger and
steadier visible migration than on the East Coast. The only Woodcock
recorded at this station in October--Oct. 19th--came during strong N.
breeze. A considerable number of Swallows occurred between June 29th
and July 4th, when there was a rush. I have no returns from the Mull of
Galloway after Oct. 23rd.

_Little Ross._--Considerable evidence of rushes in latter end of
October and in November. Mr. James Ferrier says, "Since the above
dates--_viz._, plates of last schedule, 18th Nov. to 24th Dec.--there
have been no birds." ... "No day migration observed here."

_Langness, Isle of Man._--Mr. Robt. Clyne, formerly under-keeper
at Isle of May, writes that he considers the great flights of
Linnets--grey and green--are all local, and also Starlings, and he
thinks they need hardly be mentioned in the schedules, in the meantime.
A very large congregation of Green Linnets took place at Langness
on Nov. 19th, which must be noticed in connection with our records
elsewhere, on both E. and W. coasts (J. A. H. B.),--probably about 500
to 600, Mr. Clyne says. The Committee marvels very much what can have
become of their late coadjutor Mr. Philip M. Kermode. He has not, to
Mr. Clyne's knowledge, as yet paid him a visit. Mr. Clyne mentions the
abundance of Red-legged Crows. He had entered them as "Jackdaws," but
subsequently has become aware of the error. They are numerous about
Castletown. Very little fog has been experienced, and the fog-signal
has only been once used in the past two months (_in lit._ Nov. 24th).
The Committee are much obliged to Mr. Clyne for his interesting and
well-filled schedules. He gave some interesting notes also on the
species breeding around the station.

_Chickens Rock, Isle of Man._--A very heavy rush is recorded between
15th Oct. and 21st to 26th, "the flocks being so dense that no
approximate number could be given; they formed by far the most numerous
flocks of migrants seen this season" (James Black, principal keeper).
We were singularly unfortunate at the Isle of May, the winds there
being N. of E. or W.; while here, in the Isle of Man, they were, during
the heaviest filled dates, 15th and 21st Nov., strong W. and haze, the
migrants crossing the wind, and showing largely at these more southerly
stations of our West Coast.

To Mr. M'Iver, Teacher at Culken, in Assynt, Sutherland, I am obliged
for some land notes of interest, which will appear under the various
species in connection with Stoir Head Lighthouse.


Report under Species.

Turdidæ.--While in 1883, Spring migration almost escaped notice on the
West Coast, in 1884 a rush was very evident between the 18th and 20th
Feb., at stations south of Clyde, such as at Corsewall, and indications
of same movement north of Clyde, at Skerryvore; but most records south
of Clyde. Doubtless Isle of Man could also testify to this, but we have
no schedules thence till date of July 20th, when Mr. Clyne went there.
There are also a few movements in March at Skerryvore and Skervuile.
In both months winds light S.S.E. or S.E. In autumn, much greater than
on the East coast. Every station from Cape Rhu Stoir, south, gave
movements, as follows:--Rhu Stoir (slight), Barra Head (six seen, 19th
Nov.), Rona (light, and only in July), Kyleakin (light indication, 15th
Nov.), Skerryvore (a number, 12th, 15th and 16th Nov.), Dhuheartach
(light, 15th, 16th to 24th Oct., a few as early as 4th July and 1st
Aug., probably local), Sound of Mull (few only, on 19th Sept. and
19th Dec.), Skervuile (light, in November), Rhinns of Islay (enormous
rush of Redwings, Thrushes, Fieldfares, Blackbirds, with Woodcocks,
Larks, Crows, 14th to 19th Nov.), and southwards, at Lamlash, Arran
(good indication on 10th), at Corsewall (a rush on 10th), at Mull of
Galloway (rushes, between 10th and 13th and 23rd), and at Little Ross
(mostly of Blackbirds). Winds, north of Clyde, in October northerly
and westerly, and in November southerly and easterly; for the most
part returns lighter in October than in November, and great rushes
in November at stations south of Clyde, where winds, during latter
half of October and November, were S. and easterly. Great rushes all
this time, correlating with East Coast of England, but not so much
observed on East Coast of Scotland, owing to winds then being N., and
never S., of E. or W. The species mentioned are for the most part
Thrushes and Blackbirds, Fieldfares and Red-wings, but there is reason
to believe that the latter really bulk largely in the migration, as
where the bird is distinguished from the Thrush or Mavis they appear
to have come in numbers,, as at Isle of Man (R. Clyne) and Rhinns of
Islay (Peter Anderson and Wm. Ross). The migration extended over a
considerable time; yet the rushes were remarkable for intensity and
uniformity in time at the various stations. The earliest record given
is at Dhuheartach (July 4th), but may have been a local movement, along
with two other summer records. Next in August (1st, 10th and 28th, a
few). Actual first migration in mass commencing Sept. 19th, 21st, and
25th at Sound of Mull, M'Arthur's Head, and Corsewall, respectively.
The latest records reaching me date Dec. 19th, at Sound of Mull,--a
solitary Blackbird; and by the 19th Nov. the body of the rush was past,
the latest record being on that date at Rhinns of Islay. The rush
was strictly defined, and there are not many full records before the
last week in October. The earliest species recorded (excluding July)
is Thrush, and the next Fieldfares, at Skervuile. The latest species
recorded are Blackbirds, at Sound of Mull. Those species which bulk
largest are Blackbirds and Thrushes; and those least, Fieldfares.
Redwings are probably more numerous than actually recorded, as all our
reporters do not perhaps distinguish them.

Saxicolinæ.--_Note._--For all purposes of this Report, "Stonechats"
and Wheatears are identical. Where true Stonechats are recognised
and mentioned, the records relating to these are kept distinct. In
Spring: earliest Wheatears at Sound of Mull (29th March); latest,
single bird at Skerryvore, 14th May, and one on 11th; appearance of
rush at Skerryvore on 22nd, twelve birds at the lantern, fresh S.,
haze; and at Skervuile indications on 22nd to 24th, light E. and S.E.
In Autumn: earliest at Isle of Man stations, 2nd, 9th, and 10th Aug.;
almost a rush on 10th at Chickens Rock; and several, 9th and 10th, at
Langness. [_Note._--Chickens Rock reporter calls them "Stonechats,"
but Langness reporter correctly terms them "Wheatears."] Then at Rhu
Stoir, in the north, comes the next earliest date, 16th Aug. Thereafter
stations returning them are Rhu Stoir, Skerryvore, Dhuheartach,
Skervuile, Chickens Rock, and Langness. Bush appears most decided at
the early dates at Isle of Man; and again between 20th and 24th Aug. at
Dhuheartach, N. of Clyde, and at Skervuile; whilst a third considerable
movement is noticeable on 15th and 26th Sept., at Isle of Man. The
latter is also the latest date on record. Besides Wheatears we have the
following records of true Stonechats (Stonechat, Pratincola rubicola).
Earliest at Dhuheartach, August; and at Skervuile between 20th and
26th, accompanying rush of the last species. Of Redstarts only one
record; and two or three at Langness on 8th Sept. Winds in August at
most localities, S., S.E. and S.W., light or fresh.

Silviinæ.--In spring only one record, _viz._, Robin; one, at Monach
Isles, on 7th April, S.E., clear; and a rush at Corsewall on 29th
March. In autumn: earliest at Kyleakin, 24th Aug., light S. (Two
previous records on 19th and 28th July at Rona, Skye, are in the
debatable ground between local and general migration.) In September
two single records only, at Sound of Mull and M'Arthur's Head, both on
19th, at which latter station it is reported as "arriving in winter."
One Blackcap, female, sent me for identification from Skerryvore, on
16th Nov., moderate N.E., haze, completes our records of this group.

Phylloscopinæ, Gold-crested Wren.--Evident rush noticeable in spring,
when great numbers, along with the Robins, were seen at Corsewall
on 29th March. One bird occurred at Monach Isles, "new to Mr.
Youngclause," but accurately described, therefore hitherto rare at that
station; and one is recorded from Rona Skye, but no date given. In
autumn a considerable migration, beginning with the earliest at Sound
of Mull, on 28th Aug., strong S., with showers. Ending with latest at
Lamlash, on 16th Nov., a single bird. (Note here the exactness of how
even single records on West coast agree with movements on the East
coast.) Scattered records occur at Lamlash, Firth of Clyde, and at
Corsewall, between 10th and 19th Sept.; almost a rush on latter dates.
Rush on 24th at Little Ross, and indications of ditto at Langness, on
17th and 18th; desultory records at Little Ross before these dates,
11th to 22nd. In October evidence of rushes on night of the total
eclipse of the moon, _viz._, 4th Oct., between the same hours, 9 and
12 midnight, the hours of total eclipse of greatest darkness, just as
was observed by Mr. Geo. E. Paterson and myself at Isle of May, on the
East coast; another indication of a rush, between Oct. 19th and 23rd,
at Mull of Galloway. Only single records at Dhuheartach, Skervuile,
and Lamlash in November; but, as before remarked, these single records
marvellously coincide with East Coast records, and are therefore
important. Wind at stations returning, mostly light and various, W.,
E., and S. Night of eclipse, light W., cloudy and dark. Of Willow
Warblers, a few on 10th and 11th Sept., at Little Ross.

Acrocephalinæ.--No records either spring or autumn. The negative
evidence is worth positive record.

Paridæ.--Two records only. At Mull, of Galloway, on Sept. 10th, two
Titmice, in strong S. wind at lantern, and at Sound of Mull, two
struck, but not killed, on Oct. 30th, light S.W. How far these are only
local movements or not, it is difficult to know with the small data yet
to hand.

Troglodytidæ.--On March 30th, one Common Wren returned in schedule from
Monach Isles. Fresh south haze. It would be interesting to know the
original starting place of this solitary Wren. The newly-discovered
insular variety of St. Kilda is, however, probably entirely resident
there all winter. Nevertheless we would like specimens of Wrens from
Monach Isles at all seasons for examination. In September, one occurred
at Lismore, sitting on rock, on 22nd, light N.E. wind and haze. In
October a single bird at Rhu Stoir, at noon, strong S. and rain, and
three occurred at Lamlash on Nov. 4th, flying south against a strong
S.W. wind and showers.

Motacillidæ.--Only spring record of Wagtails on May 11th two males and
two females at Rhu Stoir. In autumn, earliest Aug. 27th, at Skerryvore,
when one remained three days on the rock, indicating thus the
correlating rush on 31st at Langness, where about a hundred in a large
flock of young Pied Wagtails were seen all day. These are called "Grey
Wagtails or young Pied Wagtails" by Mr. Clyne. The true Grey Wagtail is
a yellow bird with a black throat and very long tail. [Surely British
ornithologists can find a more descriptive and truer name than Grey
Wagtail for _Motacilla boarula_. If confusion occurs amongst ordinary
observers as to names, it is as often the fault of the naturalists who
misapplied the names in the first instance as not.] In September a
further rush of the same young Pied Wagtails observable on the 10th at
Langness--a flock seen--and a dozen at Rhinns of Islay on 7th; and a
few at Barra Head and one at Dhuheartach on Sept. 1st. In October a few
at Langness, on the 6th, the latest given.

Motacillidæ, Pipits.--Earliest Meadow Pipit in spring, single records
on 8th and 21st, at Skerryvore, light S.E. haze and fresh N.W. clear
respectively. One rested on lantern of Lamlash Light on May 2nd. In
autumn, the rush of Meadow Pipits took place at Isle of Man--Langness
during Sept. 4th (a lot), 9th (very many), 24th (large flock), 29th
(large flock). Earliest, August 31st (large flock). Later, a few in
October at Skerryvore, on 6th and 16th, fresh S.W. breeze, and at same
station on 1st and 12th Nov., fresh S.W., rain.

Muscicapidæ, Flycatchers.--Only one record at Longness (R. Clyne), the
first record in six years' observation, on Sept. 11th. Mr. Clyne has
met with the Pied Flycatcher on Isle of May, as well as the Spotted,
but these two seen on Isle of Man are only designated "Flycatchers." As
the Pied Flycatcher breeds in Cumberland and N. of England, it would be
interesting to know which species (or if both) visits Isle of Man.

Hirundinidæ, Swallows.--Dates of arrivals are as follows:--March
30th, at Corsewall. It is worthy of note that I observed a Swallow
at Glendoune Girvan hawking for insects as late in autumn of 1884 as
Nov. 8th (see East Coast Report). May 11th, three seen at Rhu Stoir
(an early arrival for Sutherland W. coast, J. A. H. B.), light south,
one seen at Skerryvore, light S.E.; 17th, one at Skerryvore, fresh,
S.W.; 14th, three at Lamlash; 19th, several all day at Rhinns of Islay,
light S.E., haze; 21st, one seen at Rhu Stoir, light S.; 22nd, two Sand
Martins at Barra Head; June 3rd and 4th, two Sand Martins at Barra
Head, light N., cloudy; 19th, two Swallows at Kyleakin, flying S.,
light S. and clear; 22nd, one Swallow at Rhu Stoir, light fog and rain;
29th, great numbers (rush) flying around at Mull of Galloway, and ditto
flying E. at same place on 30th; and on 30th one seen at Cape Wrath; in
July, eight Swallows on 3rd and "scores" on 4th (probably local at Mull
of Galloway, preparing for departure); one at Langness on. 25th; in
August, flock at Langness of Swallows on 20th, and another on 25th; in
September, several on 5th, at Langness, and on 8th and 10th, and single
records at same place, and at Rhinns of Islay on 29th and 30th; in
October, a large flock of Swallows and a party of twelve at Langness,
and a flock at Chickens Rock on 6th; a flock of twelve on 19th at
Langness, the latest record.

Fringillidæ.--Very few returns in spring. A few Grey Linnets on May
12th at Skervuile, and a few at Rona, Skye, on 26th, being all. In
autumn, a rush, and earliest record save one, at Rhuvaal, of young
Grey Linnets flying W. on Aug. 20th, and a few same day at Skervuile.
The earliest date is a flock at Isle of Man (Langness) on July 29th.
Latest record on Nov. 19th of Green Linnets, a rush of 700 or 800, and
rushes between 4th and 19th, all at Langness. Bushes during latter end
of October at Langness, and sufficient indications at several stations
N. of Clyde, as Kyleakin, Skervuile, and Rhinns of Islay. This species
bulks largest in all the schedules. Other species noticed are Sparrows
(large flock at Langness, Oct. 13th); "Mountain Sparrow" (true Tree
Sparrow), one at Rhinns of Islay; "Small Linnets" (Twites or Redpoles?)
at Rhinns of Islay, Oct. 21st; Chaffinch, a few stray entries at
Dhuheartach, one found dead on rock on Nov. 2nd, others seen on 17th
and 19th (male), and a flock at Langness on Oct. 3rd.

Emberizidæ, Buntings.--Snow Buntings in spring, 203 on 14th to 17th
March at Barra Head; a large flock at Rhu Stoir on 16th, and one
female, same place, on 24th; flock at Monach Isles April 4th; one
female at Rhu Stoir as late as June 2nd, fresh various rain. In
autumn, records light everywhere. One in October only at Barra Head;
ten on Nov. 2nd at Cape Wrath; ten on 7th at Barra Head; odd birds
at Skerryvore and Dhuheartach on 16th, and an apparent rush or local
flight of fifty on Island at Rhinns of Islay on 14th, and a number
(with Thrushes) on 16th at same place.

Alaudidæ, Larks.--Autumn migration of 1883-4 continued with some force
into January, 1884, especially noted at Kyleakin, or these may have
been local flights. In spring, Larks occur sparingly at same time
as Thrushes and Starlings. Feb. 1st, at Lamlash, and Feb. 19th at
Skerryvore; also nine (three killed) at latter station March 10th;
no more till June 15th; "Larks" at Skervuile, and four on 29th at
Dhuheartach. In July, four at Dhuheartach. In autumn, earliest record
at Dhuheartach on Aug. 1st, the only record that month; then only a
single bird all September, on 21st, at Langness. Latest record, October
24th, a few at Rhinns of Islay. The rush was very great, and took place
between the 14th and 21st October, or perhaps more compressed still
between the 14th and 19th Oct. The whole duration of time in which
Larks migrated is thus very limited this season, _viz._, between Oct.
14th and Oct. 24th, the latest date given. During the rush, which was
observable principally at Rhinns of Islay, north of Clyde, the wind
was northerly or north-westerly, the same as on the East Coast at the
same dates, which accounts for the body of the rush penetrating more to
the north and reaching further than in other winds. At Rhinns of Islay
hundreds, and on 19th thousands were seen, wind fresh W. to N.W. All
flying west. On the East Coast the winds favourable to their continued
flight prevented my observing them in any great numbers at Isle of
May, but there can scarcely be any doubt these great flights passed up
the Firth of Forth, as we had plentiful opportunities of seeing almost
continuous indications of their presence at the above dates on the Isle
of May. The stations returning Larks are Skerryvore, Dhuheartach, and
Rhinns of Islay, and Langness (only a small record on Oct. 2nd). Query,
will our Irish Coast returns show the continuance of this flight of
Larks?

Sturninæ, Starlings.--Spring, rare indications at Rhu Stoir, March
25th (probably local), one female, and at Lamlash, one on April 1st,
and March 2nd one killed, and at Corsewall on Feb. 19th, struck along
with Thrushes and Larks. The latter record may have been an indication
of real migration, the others are most likely local only. In autumn,
earliest Aug. 12th, at Isle of Man, a flock; on 23rd, a number at
Rhinns of Islay, culminating in hundreds and hundreds on August 30th at
Langness (Isle of Man), and again in hundreds and hundreds at Langness
Sept. 18th, and indication by a flock at Mull of Galloway. Again, in
October, rushes evident it may be said between 18th and 23rd, and on
29th, observable at Kyleakin (on 18th), at Mull of Galloway on 22nd and
23rd, "flocks," and on 29th by 200 or 300 at Rhinns of Islay. Another
rush along with Thrushes, &c., dating Nov. 14th, at Rhinns of Islay.
Indications of movements also at Kyleakin and Dhuheartach on Nov. 1st
and 2nd. Latest, a solitary record on Dec. 24th at Lamlash. Migration
of this species we may designate in 1884 as short, sharp and decisive.

Corvidæ, Crows.--Spring: movement of Carrion Crows, Ravens and Rooks
few, and only in February and March. In February, "Black Crows" at
Barra Head, one on 23rd, and fifteen on 14th and 15th, fresh S.E. and
strong E.; also Carrion Crows at Skerryvore (three, "very seldom seen")
flying around, fresh S. clear. Ravens, two at Cape Wrath (probably
breeding in the neighbourhood, at Craig Riabhach), light S.W. haze; and
one at Skerryvore flying N.E. Rooks at Rhu Stoir, probably belonging to
one of two rookeries in N. and W. of Sutherland, _viz._, at Cama Loch
in W. Cromarty, or at Tongue. In autumn, from 1st to 25th Aug., a very
large flock, mostly young, feeding daily around Rhu Stoir (probably a
local visitation from Cama Loch or Tongue), but Tongue Rooks are known
to feed, regularly in winter at Far-out Head in the neighbourhood of
Durness, and in severe winters are seen going there and returning in
evening. The Rhu Stoir birds are therefore more likely to belong to the
Cama Loch rookery. At Chickens Rock, Isle of Man, a number of Rooks
flying W. towards Ireland on 11th August. No records in September. In
October, Hooded and Carrion Crows flying W.S.W. for Ireland at Rhinns
of Islay, and a few seen for days at Langness, feeding, about the same
time. Records continue to increase in November, a rush of hundreds
and thousands at Rhinns of Islay by 13th, continuing in force up to
17th and 18th, flying east on 13th, but resting or flying S.W. on
17th and 18th, along with enormous rush of Curlews, Woodcocks, Snipe,
Sandpipers, Larks, Redwings, Thrushes, Starlings, Blackbirds, and a few
Jacksnipes. Latest record on 19th. Also Ravens same dates, a few, and
Jackdaws on 16th and 1st Dec. at Skerryvore and Dhuheartach.

Cypselidæ, Swifts.--On July 20th, about twenty flying S., strong E.,
rain and haze, at Skervuile, and at same station a few along with
Swallows, light E. and clear.

Cuculidæ, Cuckoo.--In spring, arrivals as follows:--At Rona Skye, May
11th, first heard, light S.W. Kyleakin, May 10th, first heard, moderate
S.S.W., haze. Sound of Mull, May 8th, first heard, moderate S.W.,
clear. Skervuile, May 10th, first seen, light E. Rhinns of Islay, May
19th, first seen, fresh E., clear. Lamlash, May 12th, first heard.
Corsewall, May 11th, first heard. Autumn, Barra Head, June 28th, 1
first seen. Mull of Galloway, 1 first seen in July. Autumn records of
Cuckoos scarce during six years' records.

Strigidæ.--Spring, April 28th, one Brown Owl for three days at
Skerryvore; and 1 Owl in May (probably Short-eared Owl) at Dhuheartach.
No autumn records.

Falconidæ.--At Skerryvore, one Sparrow Hawk on 29th. At Cape Wrath,
Game Falcon and a "Small Hawk" (Merlin?) on the coast all the year
round. In autumn, fewer records than usual on predatory visits. One
Falcon on Aug. 28th at Rhuvaal. Sparrow Hawk on 1st, and again on
19th, at Skerryvore; one on Oct. 15th and 16th at Dhuheartach; and
one Sparrow Hawk resting on sun-dial on 9th. One Eagle seen at Erraid
("rarely seen here") in November.

Pelicanidæ, Gannet.--Records in order of dates:--At Skervuile, March
10th, one flying S., fresh S.E.; 14th, one flying N., S. gale. Rhu
Stoir, April 25th, five fishing, light S.E., clear. Skervuile, April
16th, one flying N. (local?). Rona, May 25th, twelve, W. clear; 29th,
one, strong N., clear. Kyleakin, June 20th, in flock flying E., E.
clear. Lismore, 22nd, flying S., various, light, clear. Dhuheartach,
July 4th, one; 20th, flying S. Skervuile, 6th and 7th, Solans flying
S.; 23rd and 24th, Solans flying S. Little Ross, July 9th, three flying
W. from the Solway. At Rhu Stoir, Aug. 28th, rush, and passed daily in
flocks flying N. up to the middle of August (see directions of flight
at Pentland Skerries, E. Coast). During the rest of August, 24th to
30th, records are given from Rhuvaal, Skervuile, and Lamlash and Little
Ross, but directions of flight are omitted under the dates given (see
records off Cape St. Vincent). In September, a flock flying W. at
Langness on 21st, a single bird flying N. at Barra Head, and two flying
S.E. on 6th; and a late record at Lamlash on Nov. 6th (marked "late").

Anatidæ, Ducks, Geese, Swans.--Spring records of "Wild Geese" are six
flying S.E., wind E. and snow, at Kyleakin (local), and two on March
23rd flying S.W. In April, 17th and 21st, two or three flying W. and
flying S. Autumn ditto of Wild Geese, numerous. Earliest, Aug. 21st,
flying S., at Kyleakin. Latest, Dec. 9th, six flying S. at Lamlash.
Other records in Oct., but no rush evident. Of Eider Ducks there are
many records. Earliest at Rhinns of Islay, seventeen males and females
on Aug. 6th. Latest December 14th, seven males and seven females flying
S. on 3rd, and six on 22nd at Rhinns of Islay. Greatest numbers seen
at Rhinns of Islay Oct. 29th, when at least 200 were seen at 7 a.m.,
and 100 at 9 a.m. In November the "first seen this fall" at Skerryvore
on 1st, and large flock on 6th flying S., and others at Dhuheartach.
Other species are Sheldrakes (breeding at Rona), arrived in May;
Barnacle Geese, thirteen at Barra Head on Oct. 13th, resting. Wigeon,
one female, at Rhinns of Islay, on Aug. 23rd. Of Swans, two flying N.,
seen at Sound of Mull on June 2nd, with light N.W. airs. Barnacle Geese
identified by head sent me.

Columbidæ.--Two Rock Doves flying S. (local) at Kyleakin, and six Wood
Pigeons at same place on 22nd, flying S.S.W., moderate S. wind. In
August, five doves flying E. at Rhuvaal; and in December, at Rhinns of
Islay, 300 flying south, about one mile inland, light W., haze.

Rallinæ, Corn Crakes, Water Rails, &c.--Only spring record: a Corn
Crake at Barra Head on 6th June. Only autumn records: one killed at
lantern of Mull of Galloway, and one Water Rail killed at Rhinns of
Islay (sent to me in the skin, J. A. H. B.) on 23rd October.

Charadriadæ.--Large flocks of Golden Plover arrive on the coast around
Rhu Stoir during winter, when snow lies inland, and are seen onwards
after March 12th and 15th, 1884, at same station. In autumn, records
of Golden Plover unusually scarce; single ones at Sound of Mull, Sept.
19th, and Rhinns of Islay, Sept. 18th. Large flocks begin to arrive at
Rhu Stoir ("to come towards the shore") early in November, remain all
winter. At Rhinns of Islay, two "Gray Plovers," marked "rare," seen on
Oct. 6th. Usual records of Oystercatchers, not so abundant or general
as usual.

Lapwings.--One seen Feb. 15th at Barra Head; twenty on March 15th at
Rhu Stoir, and one or two single ones there on 7th and 11th; and two
on April 2nd. No great movement recorded in autumn. Rhinns of Islay,
10 flying about on 24th August and seven resting at Barra Head on 7th
October.

Scolopacidæ, Woodcock, Snipe, Curlew, Whimbrel.--Woodcock: Earliest
in autumn, Oct. 9th, one shot at Mull of Galloway. Latest, Nov. 18th,
one at Dhuheartach, resting. Indication of more general movement
between 15th, 16th, to 23rd Oct., but very slight, at Barra Head, one
on 19th at Skervuile, Rhinns of Islay, and at Dhuheartach. Snipe: Only
some three records; in September one at Skerryvore, in October one at
Dhuheartach, and in August two at Rhinns of Islay, killed. Curlews:
Numerous records from July on to November at many stations. Whimbrel:
One noticed at Langness in August. A few records of Sandpipers (see
notes under stations at Skervuile.)

Sterninæ, Terns.--Arrivals in spring: At Rona, a rush of 200 arrived
on May 11th, light S.W. and clear. At Skervuile, one first seen on May
23rd, calm; a number arrived between 24th and 31st, light, various. At
Kyleakin, Terns first seen 26th June, strong S. At M'Arthur's Head,
Terns first seen 18th June. At Rhinns of Islay, Terns first seen 23rd
and 24th July, light S.W. Query, return Journey? In autumn: Terns seen
11th and 12th at Skervuile; and more on 18th; and at Chickens Rock
large quantities flying north on August 8th. Last seen at Kyleakin on
September 6th.

Laridæ.--Considerable movements of Gulls of sorts from July 5th on
to winter. Black-headed Gulls are marked as "very few this year" at
Skervuile. Continuous flocks flew E. past Barra Head on Sept. 6th.
Continuous flocks flew N.W. past Sound of Mull in August. Skervuile
returns "numbers" about the middle of August. At one station, _viz._,
Skervuile, the following are their recorded movements: in variable
but prevailing N. to N.W. winds till Nov. 17th; thereafter light N.E.
In August: 19th, one Boatswain Gull; 26th, flock of Herring Gulls;
31st, flock of Gulls. September, two records of flock of Terns, and
Kittiwakes. Oct. 16th and 17th, ditto, ditto. November, on three dates
Boatswain Birds and Kittiwakes. At Stoir Head vast flocks of Common
Gulls and Herring Gulls passed N. Herrings "set into" Lochs Coul
and Dhu, a little to the north of this, about this time, December,
1884, which locally accounts for this rush. Most of the Common Gulls
were young. At Rhinns of Islay two "one-year-old Iceland Gulls" with
hundreds of other Gulls flying about. We are particular in recording
Gull returns, as this was an extraordinary Gull year on the East Coast.

Procellariidæ.--On July 26th one Storm Petrel on lantern at Barra Head,
the earliest record of any for six years, light E. with fog. One ditto
at Stoir Head (rare) in August, and one on Sept. 3rd at Lismore (also
rare), killed, light N.W., haze.

Alcidæ, Razorbills, Guillemots, Puffins.--On Feb. 23rd, increased
from 20th to date at Barra Head. "Marrots" and Razorbills, all March
6th to 8th, 14th to 17th, 23rd to 24th and 29th, winds light S.E. and
S.W. In April: 4th to 11th, rush at Barra Head, various, N.E., clear,
and Puffins; a few on 9th; 17th to 22nd, a few only of Marrots and
Razorbills seen. On May 6th and 7th, Puffins, Razorbills and Marrots
(Marrot or Guillemot) arrived in great numbers; and at Kyleakin two
Tysties (_i.e._ Black Guillemots) seen flying S.E. In autumn, all left
Barra Head except a few by Aug. 20th, but reappeared for a day on 30th,
on which day all the Puffins left, light S.W. In October, continuous
flocks of Puffins flying S. before a north gale at Rhinns of Islay, on
October 12th.


General Remarks.

During the past six years' Migration Reports we have to thank many of
our correspondents for the regularity with which they have acceded to
our requests. Specially must we thank the following for the unbroken
series of schedules during the past six years, _viz._: Sumburgh Head,
six years, Messrs. William Anderson (1879 and 1880), John Wilson (1880,
1881, 1882), D. M. Scott (1883 and 1884). Pentland Skerries, six years,
D. MacDonald (1879, 1880, 1881, 1882, 1884), and Mr. J. Gilmour (1884).
Dunnet Head, Caithness, five years, George McLachlan, (1879, 1880
blank), David Laidlaw (1881, 1882, 1883, 1884). Bell Rock, James Jack
(1879, 1880, 1881, 1882, 1883, 1884). Isle of May, Joseph Agnew, six
years (1879, 1880, 1881, 1882, 1883, 1884).

These stations are situated as follows:--

  Sumburgh Head      300 feet high  white fixed light.
  Pentland Skerries  170 feet high  white fixed light.
  Dunnet Head        346 feet high  white fixed light.
  Bell Rock           93 feet high  white and red revolving.
  Isle of May        240 feet high  white fixed light.

Were Bell Rock also a _fixed white light_, no doubt returns would be
equally extensive, or greater, possibly, than Isle of May. The white
fixed lights have superiority; and when this is combined with low
height over the sea and insular position, the best conditions appear,
and are only to be beaten by floating light-ships. The flash lights
have little chance to compete.

Next let us also thank the following correspondents:--At Whalsea
Skerries, 3 years, Neven Kerr (1880, 1881, 1882). N. Ronaldshay, four
years, John Tulloch (1879, 1880, 1881, 1882). Cromarty, R. S. Ritson,
four years (1880, 1881, 1882, 1883).

This class of stations are situated as follows:--

  Whalsea Skerries   148 feet  white, revolving every minute.
  N. Ronaldshay      180 feet  white, revolving every ten seconds.
  Cromarty            60 feet  red, fixed (in the town).

_Revolving_ lights, whatever the height, yield fewer returns than
_fixed_, but are better than flash or red sectors.

We also thank those who, situated at still less likely stations, have
nevertheless taken an interest in our work.

_Bressay_ sends one year's return (1882); 105 feet; red and white,
revolving every minute.

_Ross Head._--One year (1883), A. Greig; 175 feet; white and red
revolving, every half minute.

_Kinnaird Head._--One year (1884); a blank schedule, valuable on
negative grounds; 120 feet; white and red sectors, fixed.

_Girdleness._--Two years (1880 and 1884); 185 feet; white fixed. Thomas
Gallie and J. McAlister. The situation is said to be unfavourable,
apart from light or altitude.

Finally, taking the remaining lights which have returned no years
schedules, we will analyse their positions, &c.

_Start Point._--80 feet; red, fixed. Class V.

_Hoy Sound._--(55 and 115). Low, white, fixed, facing N. High ditto;
red and white sectors, fixed. V.

_Cantick Head._--115 feet; white, revolving every minute.

_Holborn Head._--75 feet; white and red flash, 10 seconds, facing N. V.

_Tarbat Ness._--175 feet; white intermittent, 2½ minutes. It is not
quite clear to me yet why this station should not yield returns (see
map), unless it be considered partially land-locked from E. and S.E.

_Buchan Ness._--130 feet; white flash, every 5 seconds; and close to
fishing village.

_Montroseness._--124 feet; white, fixed; but amongst houses. V.

We think the above analysis places almost beyond doubt that the best
position for a lights to attract birds is in a light ship (witness the
E. English Coast returns); next, an island of low elevation; next, an
island of considerable elevation, if facing east, not if facing north;
and that the worst are those at high elevations, and especially if
facing otherwise than E., on the East Coast, or on East Coast Islands,
or those in midst of towns, or in land-locked situations; that the best
description of light is "white, fixed,"--in fact, the brightest. Thus
in many instances we consider that it is owing to position and nature
of lights to a very considerable extent that we receive more schedules
from some stations than others, and none at all from the least likely,
whereas on the English East Coast all light-ships are almost equally
good as regards position.

Yet we do not allow that this is entirely the cause of least and
greatest migration at different points, because we now know well
enough, from land data, that certain tracks are preferred to others,
and that these tracks over land have very strong connection with the
East Coast Scotch principal stations, as we think our Reports will show.

As regards the influences of winds, &c., sufficient has already been
said on this head throughout the Reports, and every succeeding schedule
goes to prove our previous ones.

Analyses of the West Coast schedules almost always show much lighter
returns than those from the East Coast, even from the best West
Coast stations. Our previous five years' experience in great measure
explains why it is so, and it seems natural to expect lighter returns
on the West than on the East in most winds or weather. But, having
regard to the said experience and the facts of migration which may
now be said to be ascertained and certain, there are also one or
two additional causes for the light nature of West Coast returns as
against East Coast ones; while on the latter, the lights which give
the greatest illumination, if in other respects suitably exposed,
give the heaviest returns; on the former, it seems that the positions
of the various stations have more to do with these. Thus most of the
East Coast stations face the east, whence come the birds naturally,
and while on the west birds travel from N.W. towards S. or S.E.,
the extraordinary variety of situations, and the equally great--or
nearly so--variety of lights of no great power and brilliancy, must
undoubtedly influence the quantities of birds visible on migration. And
we find that while such stations as Kyleakin (white and red, fixed),
Isle Ornsay (white, fixed), Sound of Mull (red, green, and white
sectors), Corran Ferry (red and white sectors, fixed), &c., give small
returns, or none at all, this is resultant upon their positions even
more than their brilliancy or absence of brilliancy. And we find that
the best situated stations, such as Monach Isle (though only upper
white flash, and lower, red fixed) gives better, though uncertain,
returns, and Skerryvore (white revolving) and Dhuheartach (white
and red sector, fixed), and Rhinns of Islay (white flash every five
seconds) seem to be the surest stations north of Clyde. Indeed it is,
perhaps, almost certain that most of the land-locked stations of the
West Coast should be marked with the symbol of lowest value, V. South
of Clyde, undoubtedly, we get more into the great groove of migration
which crosses Scotland from the Firth of Forth, and if not yet so heavy
as, for instance, at the Bell Rock, Isle of May, in all the years
till 1884, yet we have more decided indications of rushes and throbs
keeping time with the East Coast movements. When to this we add a less
indented coast line, open lights, and, on the whole, greater power
and brilliancy, we expect to find all the conditions more favourable.
That this is the case our schedules for 1884 show decidedly, and even
swamp the East Coast returns for the first time in our experience.
When we come to the Isle of Man, where the Irish Channel contracts
considerably, we again find heavy rushes of birds, equalling or
exceeding those at such stations as Skerryvore and Dhuheartach and
Rhinns of Islay. Of these Langness sends the heaviest returns, but we
have there now a trained reporter, Mr. Robert Clyne, who was previously
under Mr. Agnew at the Isle of May. Mr. Clyne's eager application to
the subject now stands us in good stead.

The reason in 1884 for the contrary of the usual rule, _viz._, that
East Coast stations of Isle of May and Bell Rock usually giving heavier
returns than the West Coast stations S. of Clyde, is not far to seek
for. The heaviest rushes at Isle of Man, and all down the West Coast
S. of Clyde, occurred between the 15th to 21st and 26th October (see
under Chickens Rock especially), while at Isle of May, Firth of Forth,
no great movements of birds were visible. The winds on East Coast
of Scotland were N. and E., and rarely W., but at Isle of Man and
West Coast southerly and westerly. The migration on East Coast was
pressed down on to the East English Coast by northerly winds. But on
the West Coast birds travelled with light arid most favourable winds,
concentrating their forces at the central and commanding stations
of the Isle of Man. We regret we have no returns from the other
Isle of Man stations. I hope the men are not disheartened by the
non-appearance for two years of the West Coast of England Report which
was entrusted to Mr. Philip M. Kermode. We earnestly hope they will
now continue to send in schedules, the Isle of Man stations being most
important.

The rapid increase of the Stock Dove in South and Central Scotland
is very remarkable. They appeared commonly in East Stirlingshire in
1884-85, and have been nesting for some years in the Vale of Menteith,
one of the high roads of migration. Many crossed the North Sea this
past season to the East English coasts. Migration undoubtedly has a
great influence upon extension of range, and the process seems easy to
trace out; and it is very interesting also to find a similar extension
of the Stock Dove to the rabbit-burrows of the sandy coast of Moray of
late years (_auct._ Rev. Dr. Gordon and Capt. Dunbar Brander).

It appears useful in this place to speak of the comparative numbers
of Woodcocks in the past six years. At the conclusion of our General
Remarks on the last Report (1883) we called attention to the unusually
large movement of Woodcocks, and to the area which appeared to have
been principally selected by them before their final departure for N.
Europe. As mentioned already (Report 1883), we had very few indications
of their passage over Isle of May or East Coast lighthouse stations;
and all stations returning any mark them as "rare" (see Report, 1882)
or "rare in spring." Pentland Skerries, Bell Rock and Isle of May in
six years have only recorded amongst them an infinitesimal number of
spring records, and almost always with the remark "rare."

In 1879, which was a good Woodcock year in Scotland, we have not
a single lighthouse record from either W. or E. Coasts. Yet I saw
nineteen killed one day near here. In 1880, no records. In 1881,
no spring records and scarce in autumn. Records at Butt of Lewis,
Skerryvore and Lismore. Earliest, Oct. 28th. In 1882, a few spring
records, one at Isle of May, April 9th ("not remembered before at this
season," J. A.) Considerable and steady records, however, in autumn
at five stations, north of Pentland Skerries inclusive, and at Isle
of May. Rush Oct. 20th (twenty shot at Isle of May). In 1883, one
record in spring at Bell Rock, April 7th, and rare in autumn; none till
October, when a few at Monach Isle, Dhuheartach, Lismore, Loch Ryan,
and in November at Kyleakin and Lismore, all between 29th and 31st
Oct., indicating a rush. In 1884, which was a good Woodcock season on
shore, with immense spring returns visible between Firths of Forth and
Clyde, yet only two spring records at Pentland Skerries and Isle of
May, April 3rd and March 30th respectively. In autumn, near this, one
day I saw eighteen Woodcocks killed. The similarity of circumstances of
1879 and 1880 are worth attention. A considerable number of Woodcocks
were killed in October and November, 1884, at Isle of May, and
indications of arrivals very general. The spring records must have been
weakly birds (one was disabled), as they appeared long after the spring
return rush, great numbers being observable on land on 8th, 9th, 10th
to 12th March. Indeed it would almost appear that any records sent from
Island- or East-Coast stations during spring were of probably maimed or
weakly birds, or birds delayed long after the "return of the Woodcocks"
in March. As before remarked, the spring birds were all small russet
cocks, and they rested 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th March between Firths
of Forth and Clyde, "lifted" again, and did not alight till they had
crossed the German Ocean (see 1883 Report, pp. 80, 81). The autumn rush
was considerably later than usual in 1884 (see details).

Regarding the unusually extensive migration of Gulls to our coasts in
1884-85, several suggestions as to the influencing causes are readily
at hand, but the following appears to have the greatest weight and
importance.

As we are informed in 'Nature,' of Feb. 12th, 1885, recent Norwegian
explorations in the Spitzbergen seas show that the year 1884 was a very
remarkable ice year. "The west side of Spitzbergen was blocked by a
belt of land ice the whole summer through, whilst the east side, which
is nearly always blocked with ice, was more open than it had been for
many years. These conditions, there seems little doubt, depend on the
prevailing direction of the winds."

Now, the temperature of water having been lowered by the accumulation
of ice along the W. coast of Spitzbergen, which is comparatively
approximate to the furthest N.E. influence of the Gulf Stream, it
seems natural to suppose that a deflection of the branch of the Gulf
Stream, caused by the colder Arctic ice and current, the accumulation
of which former was caused by the prevailing N. and E. winds on the
Arctic Seas, would reach round past the S. end of Spitzbergen to the
East Coast, and would cause the unusually open sea there. But the main
channel of the Gulf Stream would still be towards the S.W., and would
afford the natural outlet for all manner of ocean life, which requires
certain temperatures; and which, such as Entomostraca, Copepods,
Molluscan larvæ, &c., afford food to other higher organisms.

The great quantity of such food which in ordinary summers and autumns
accumulate around the shores of Spitzbergen, or in the warm shallow
summer seas off the N. coast of Europe, no doubt retire to deeper water
on the approach of winter. In unusually cold seasons the retreat is
continued, following the course of the milder Gulf Stream until more
temperate seas are reached.

In the course of its retreat it is discovered by vast shoals of fish,
which pursue these minute forms of life even to the uttermost limits
of its possible extension, up certain firths arid inlets of our East
Coast of Scotland. Naturally also the last link of the migratory chain
is taken up by the enormous population of Gulls and other species of
sea-fowl, as we know has been the case in the winter of 1884-5 in the
Firth of Forth.

In the log of the steam whaler 'Eclipse,' Captain D. Gray (see Report,
_antea_, p. 7) in summer, repeated mention is made of the unusual
abundance of "whale food" in the Spitzbergen seas, and I am indebted
also to Captain Gray, through Mr. Thomas Southwell, of Norwich, for a
return of sea-temperatures of the same seas.

Mr. Hugh R. Milne, of the Marine Station at Granton, sends me some
temperatures taken from the Firth of Forth, extending over June,
1884, to January, 1885, taken at three points, _viz._, Isle of May,
Queensferry, and near Alloa. These data, in connection with the vast
swarms of sprats or garvies (_Clupea sprattus_) and the attendant
thousands of Gulls, are useful for future comparisons, and I append
them here. It would be interesting to know similarly taken temperatures
of the Tay Estuary, which was completely deserted this season by these
migratory fish, and consequently by the birds also. If we had also
means of knowing the temperatures of the Firth of Forth in 1872-73,
when a similar vast migration of Sprats and Gulls was witnessed, such
data would assuredly lead to most interesting, useful, and scientific
results.

One great difference in the migration of Gulls in 1884-5 from that of
1872-3 is that in 1884-5 there were very few Glaucous Gulls (_Larus
glaucus_) or Iceland Gulls (_L. islandicus_), but in 1872-3 both these
species were in vast numbers, comparatively speaking. It seems to me
possible that the 1872-3 migration indicated by these Arctic Gulls was
of even wider and more extensive influence than that of 1884-5. But of
course there is room here for still further elucidation and collection
of statistics.

Again, while the Tay usually is visited by sprats in great sprat
seasons, equally, or nearly so, with the Forth, and was so visited
in 1872-3 though not to the extent that the Forth was, in 1884-5
it appears to have been almost utterly deserted by fish and bird
alike. The cause was, no doubt, comparative scarcity of entomostracan
life, dependent, most likely, upon certain undefined conditions
of sea-temperatures, affected, possibly, from the river-basin
of Tay and its tributaries. If light can be thrown upon these
not-difficult-to-ascertain data, in a few years, at most, much of our
uncertainty as to causes and effects of migration of Entomostraca,
Sea-fish, and even Salmon and migratory Salmonidæ will be removed.

_Note._--The figures in brackets were not observed, but are entered
hypothetically.

Mr. Milne, in writing to me, adds, "I believe that in hot summer days
the temperature at Alloa would be 70° or more, and during severe winter
weather would certainly be down to 32°. My belief is that in October
and April the temperature is uniform all over the Firth, and from
April till October it is higher at Alloa than at the Isle of May, the
difference attaining a maximum between July and August. From October to
April it is lower at Alloa than at the May, the difference attaining a
maximum about the end of the year. The maximum difference between the
two places will be about 10° or 12°, giving a rate of change of 0° 2′
per mile." Suspended matter taken in ten samples at Kincardine on Forth
varied from 5 to 20 grains per gallon, averaging about 10 grains.

_Note._--It was at Kincardine on Forth, the narrowest part of the
Firth, between Alloa and Borrowstoness, that the greatest quantities of
sprats were taken.

I personally visited Kincardine several times both in 1872-3 and
1884-5, and witnessed the extraordinary congregation of Gulls and
the myriads of sprats. In 1884-5 one smack anchored off the pier
at Kincardine took 16 tons of garvies (or sprats) during one tide.
There were, in all, some twenty smacks all lying anchored at this
narrow part of the Firth, but all of these were not fishing with the
small meshed nets; some for herrings only. Hundreds of tons were sold
at from 14_s._ to, latterly, 8_s._ a ton, and were spread over the
adjoining farm lands for manure. Hundreds of tons more were sold for
making up a compost manure--being in themselves considered too rich
in phosphates--to a firm in Alloa. Hundreds of tons more besprinkled
the mud-flats at low tide, or hung by their gills in festoons along
the tangle covered timbers of the piers. The water itself was alive
with them, and every wave that broke on the lower piers left the piers
covered with glittering garvies. A man with a minnow landing-net could
have caught an indefinite number by sweeping each wave as it came in.

Mr. J. T. Cunninghame, of the Scottish Marine Zoological Station,
Granton, in reply to inquiries, tells me that "his notes dating 28th
Nov. show that Copepods were very numerous and varied in the Firth of
Forth, as were also Molluscan larvæ." The temperatures of the water, as
will be seen by Mr. Milne's notes in December and January, 1885, were
lower than at any other time of the year being (38) and 35 near Alloa
(and Kincardine) as compared with 41 and 39 at Queensferry, and 44 and
43 at Isle of May. By the 17th Nov., as is recorded in our Migration
Report, garvies are reported as very abundant around the Isle of May,
at which time the temperature at that point was 49° against 47° at
Queensferry and 45° at Alloa. These shoals were accompanied by great
numbers of Gulls at Isle of May.

As early as March, 1884, vast numbers of Gulls are reported to have
been fishing off N. Unst in Shetland for many weeks together, such an
assemblage never having been observed before by the oldest inhabitant.

I feel convinced that a steady and carefully recorded journal of bird
movements will result in very extensive additions to our knowledge of
the natural laws which govern them.

In conclusion, I may say that in the course of another year's work we
hope to be able to produce some certain data regarding this matter of
relative conditions of the temperatures of the Arctic Ocean in 1884-5,
and the data already given above, from inquiries now being made by
Mr. Alexander Buchan of the Scottish Meteorological Society; also
the connections between such data and the migrations of Entomostraca
and "whales food"; also to institute a comparison with similar or
dissimilar conditions in other years.

Mr. William Evans, a most careful and excellent Field Naturalist, sends
me records of the occurrence of high Arctic birds on the Firth of Forth
in 1884. The Grey Plover, Knot, and Bar-tailed Godwit were seen on the
9th August (which, however, was the first day Mr. Evans visited the
shore). The Sanderling was seen on the 14th August, and the Little
Stint on the 20th.

Anticipatory of our 1885 Report, it may interest our readers here
to learn that the spring migration of 1885 has developed still more
extraordinary results, such as the migration of Pied Flycatchers dining
the first week in May, past Pentland Skerries, Isle of May, and other
stations; and the occurrence of such rarities as Ortolan Buntings,
Red-backed Shrike, &c., at Isle of May about the same time. White
Wagtails also have been commonly observed at land-stations. (_Vide_ R.
Gray, Esq.)

The best thanks of the Committee are due to the above-named
observers for their painstaking records and valued aid; and it is
an added pleasure to acknowledge assistance received from several
ornithologists, including Messrs. James Andrews, of Swanage,
Dorsetshire; O. V. Aplin, of Banbury (notes from Barmouth District); W.
Duckworth, of Carlisle; T. E. Kelsall, of Balliol College, Oxford; Rev.
H. A. Macpherson, of Carlisle; and Mr. Arthur Patterson, of Preston.
Special acknowledgment is due to the Rev. H. A. Macpherson for most
hearty and welcome co-operation. The recorder trusts to enlist further
aid from the naturalists of the West of England and Wales, as it will
much enhance the value of the report to include in it observations
made by trained and experienced ornithologists, from whom alone can be
expected notes on critical and rare species.

In dealing with the mass of information received it has been thought
best to treat of it under the following heads.

I.--A few General Remarks on the Report.

II.--Reports on the Migratory-Season of 1884, communicated by several
of the light-keepers and others.

III.--A Diary of the Principal Migratory Movements, which gives an idea
of the importance of each movement, the area covered by it, and also
indicates the species migrating in company.

IV.--A separate Report on each species.


I.--General Remarks.

The great mass of migrants during the past autumn seem to have passed
stations decidedly south of Anglesea. The great movements appear to
have taken place between Oct. 21st and 24th (inclusive), during which
period some dozen species were noted; and again between Nov. 10th
and 14th (inclusive), this being the most important movement, and
applied no less than eighteen species observed at the lighthouses and
lightships alone.

The report embraces notes on some rare or interesting species,
including _Motacilla alba_, _Lanius major_, _Ampelis garrulus_, _Chen
albatus_, _Querquedula circia_, _Phalaropus hyberboreus_, _Machetes
pugnax_, _Hydrochelidon nigra_; whilst the scarcity or entire absence
of _Passer montanus_, _Corvus cornix_, and _Bernicla brenta_, and the
presence of _Bernicla leucopsis_, are of interest to one accustomed
to East Coast observations. The capture, too, of eight _Procellaria
pelagica_ at the South Bishop, on Oct. 14th, is a noteworthy incident.
The lanterns vary not a little in their death-dealing attractions,
those of the Bardsey, South Bishop, Smalls, Nash (E.), Godrevy, and
Eddystone lighthouses being most seductive, occasionally commanding no
less than two hundred victims in a single night.

To be able to offer opinions, or even to speculate on the various
problems connected with the migration of birds on the West Coast of
England, will require much careful study based upon reports for some
years, and it will be much regretted that this coast has been neglected
for several seasons.

Chief attention should, perhaps, be paid to the relationship which
exists between migration as observed on this coast and the great
land mass of Ireland; thus to enable us, if possible, to give some
indication of the lines of route, if any, taken by both summer and
winter visitors and partial migrants on their passages to and from that
country.

To this end a series of careful observations must and should be made,
and special attention be given by observers to the direction taken
by all migratory birds. This, it is thought, has not received the
attention it deserves, and, as it may add a special value to the
observations made, it is hoped that the light-keepers (especially those
on light-vessels) and others, who have so very willingly helped in the
past, will give attention to this request.


II.--Reports from Stations on the Season.

_Carlisle District_ (Messrs. Macpherson and Duckworth).--After a
westerly hurricane on Jan. 26th, land birds (Jackdaw and Moorhen), as
well as Guillemots, Puffins, Gulls, and Sheldrakes were washed ashore,
while Mr. Cook found a large Skua; many Oystercatchers were observed
far inland. February and March were dull; the usual fowl on the Loughs,
including Pintail, Shovellers, Tufted Duck, and Barnacle Geese, were
numerous during the first half of March, and a large flock were seen;
as also a Goosander in mid-April. The general calm of the first week of
April induced the van of our army of summer visitants to push on early;
but the subsequent prevalence of easterly and north-easterly winds
checked the main body. On the afternoon of April 29th the wind changed
from east to west, and we had an immense influx of House Martins and
other birds on the 30th. August was fine, and many Waders arrived
early; but it appeared that the chief arrivals took place between
the last week this month and the second week of September. Geese and
Ducks arrived before the middle of October; and the heavy westerly
winds on the 26th and 27th brought ashore the Pomatorhine Skua and
Leach's Petrel. The weather continued chiefly open until the end of the
year, but most Waders had left by the end of October. In November and
December the Geese and Ducks alone relieved the monotony of the Solway.

_St. Bees_ L.H.--Mr. Henry Nott tells me that birds are generally
few, unless Starlings and Lapwings; Starlings have been exceptionally
numerous during the winter; as for Thrushes and Blackbirds he scarcely
ever sees one.

_Morecambe Bay_ L.V.--Mr. Henry Clavell informs me that very few birds
have passed this station during the past two years.

_Nash_ (E.) L.H. (Mr. Henry Nicholas).--Birds have not been noticed in
such large flocks as last year. The most decided and general movement
took place between the 2nd and 15th of November. Wild Ducks have been
very scarce this year, and Sky Larks and Starlings have not been
observed in such immense numbers as in years past.

_Start_ L.H.--Mr. William Jones notes that in very few instances birds
are observed at his station.


III.--Diary of Principal Movements.

The order of the stations is from north to south. The wind and weather

9 a.m.; Oct. 18th and 20th, flocks, composed of Linnets, Finches, and
Starlings, between 7 and 10 a.m. South Bishop L.H., Oct. 14th, many,
along with other species, from 11 p.m. to daylight. Milford L.H., Oct.
14th, a few; 23rd and 24th, along with Larks and Starlings. Bull Point
L.H., Oct. 18th, about forty at 7.30 a.m. Scarweather L.V., Jan. 4th,
1885, a flock at 10.30 a.m. It is possible that in addition to _Linota
cannabina_, that _flavirostris_ and even _rufescens_ may be referred to.

_Pyrrhula europæa_, Bullfinch.--Morecambe Bay L.V., Oct. 21st, several,
in company with Larks, from 10 to 12 a.m., flying S.S.W.

_Plectrophanes nivalis_, Snow Bunting.--Carlisle District, Nov. 15th,
first seen at Rickerby; large flocks on Crossfell same time; shot
a pair of old birds, very white, at Silloth, Dec. 11th; a flock on
Skinburness, same time.

_Sturnus vulgaris_, Starling.--The very numerous entries of the
movements of this species would furnish quite a voluminous report
in itself, and forms quite a feature of the returns. It is noted
frequently at all the stations making returns, save two, between Aug.
31st, at Flatholm L.H., and Feb. 15th, 1885, at the South Bishop L.H.;
often in very considerable numbers, and both during the daytime and
at night, when occasionally many perish at the lanterns. The number
and continuity of the movements of this species, as observed at some
stations, may, in a measure, be due to its well-known habit of massing
in the autumn and winter. These flocks disperse in the morning,
when the birds seek their food at varying distances from their
roosting-quarters. They return in the evening, and in doing so would
pass many of the West Coast stations, not a few of which are situated
in estuaries easily crossed. For further details of the movements of
this species consult the diary preceding this section of the Report.

_Corvus corone_, Crow.--St. Tudwall's L.H., Oct. 4th, several at 9
a.m., flying W. Carnarvon Bay L.H., Oct. 23rd, a large flock, passing
S. at 8 a.m. South Stack L.H., a flock, passing S. at 10 a.m. Selker
L.V., Nov. 10th, one going S. at 2.30 p.m. Bideford Bar L.H., Dec.
12th, forty at 7.30 a.m.

_Corvus cornix_, Hooded Crow.--Merionethshire, one seen about the end
of October. Carlisle District, "a single straggler" shot, Nov. 14th.

_Corvus frugilegus_, Rook.--Smalls L.H., Nov. 7th, seven at 9.30 a.m.;
Nov. 8th, a very large flock at 10.30 a.m. Scarweather L.V., Nov. 14th,
a very large flock at 11 a.m.

_Alauda arvensis_, Sky Lark.--Under this heading and the general term
of "Lark" there are very numerous entries, most of which doubtless
refer to this species; but experience leads one to opine that in some
instances the Meadow Pipit, or "Titlark," may be meant. Recorded from
most stations between Sept. 14th at Eddystone and Feb. 17th, 1885,
at the South Bishop. On Oct. 21st there was a general movement, the
species being observed from the Selker L.V. to the Eddystone L.H. Great
numbers occurred at the Longships L.H. on Sept. 29th, at the South
Bishop L.H. on Oct. 14th, and on Nov. 4th and 6th at the Smalls Rock
L.H. Migrates during the daytime, and rarely at night. Mr. Hills, of
the South Bishop, says that flocks of Larks pass south, during the
daytime, from November until the end of January.

_Cypselus apus_, Swift.--Spring: Carlisle District, April 28th, one
flying at a considerable height. Autumn: Carlisle District, Aug. 17th,
one seen; another on the 19th. Flatholm L.H., Aug. 26th, continuous
flocks of Swifts and Martins passing south at 10 a.m.

_Cuculus canorus_, Cuckoo.--Carlisle District, April 14th, seen and
heard.

Striges "Large-horned Owl" (? _Asio accipitrinus_).--South Bishop
L.H., Oct. 14th, one hovering around the lantern, between 11 p.m. and
daylight, making, along with three "Falcon Hawks," "sad havoc" with the
numerous smaller species present.

_Asio accipitrinus_, Short-eared Owl.--Carlisle District, Sept. 6th,
one adult female; one in November; strange to say, no others.

Accipitres.--Under the heading of "Hawk" there are the following
records:--Morecambe Bay L.V., May 11th, one flying E. by S. in the
early morning. South Bishop L.H., Oct. 14th, between 11 p.m. and
daylight, three "Falcon Hawks" and a "Large-horned Owl" made "sad
havoc" among the numerous birds around the lantern. St. Tudwall's L.H.,
Oct. 18th, one small Hawk at sunset going S.W. Helwick L.V., Oct. 30th,
a Hawk at 7 a.m.

_Falco peregrinus_, Peregrine.--Carlisle District, Oct. 11th, one, near
Allonby.

Rockliffe; another, male adult, shot, Nov. 8th; female and male, juv.,
subsequently.

_Ardea cinerea_, Heron.--Bardsey L.H., Aug. 28th, one on the island;
Sept. 13th, two in the evening. St. Tudwall's L.H., Nov. 29th, one at 3
p.m.; Jan. 23rd, 1885, one at 2 p.m.

Dec. 18th and 19th, single birds seen.

"Grey Geese."--Carlisle District, Oct. 10th, large arrival, most of
which passed on. Mr. Macpherson's impression is that Bean, Pink-footed,
and Grey-lag, all occurred during the autumn and winter; but the only
birds shot belonged to the first-named, _A. segetum_. Two of these were
shot, out of a flock of twenty-five. Carnarvon Bay L.V., Jan. 4th,
1885, forty at 10 a.m., flying N.N.W.

_Chen albatus_, Snow Goose.--Carlisle District, Aug. 22nd, one adult,
Allonby, 9 a.m., weather very hazy; flew from west (Irish Channel?) to
east. Followed up all day, to no purpose. Seen again Sept. 8th and Oct.
14th. It is impossible to shoot Geese on the Solway in open weather,
except at night.

_Bernicla leucopsis_, Barnacle Goose.--Carlisle District, large
arrival about Oct. 10th. A flock of considerably more than a hundred
rose off Rockliffe Marsh, and pitched on the Burgh side, early on

Rockliffe in December.

_Cygnus bewicki_, Bewick's Swan.--Carlisle District, Nov. 23rd, single
bird, Monkhill; sharp frost.

Anatidæ.--Teal. A pair noted at St. Bees on Aug. 24th. The references
to Ducks, at both the Selker and Dee light-vessels, are very numerous;
at the latter "Black Duck" (? Scoters) were first noted on Sept. 10th.
"Ducks" are chronicled from many stations, but unfortunately without
reference to species.

killed against the lantern at 8.45 p.m.; on this night, Snipe,
Woodcocks, and Lapwings were also immolated; Oct. 13th, another killed
between the hours 2 and 5 a.m., again along with the species just
mentioned; Oct. 15th, one killed at 11 p.m.

about a dozen, passing S. at 9.30 a.m. Caldy L.H., Oct. 29th, fourteen
at 3 p.m.; "their first appearance this season." Nov. 13th, several at
the lantern, along with other species, at 3.30 a.m.; two killed. 14th,
a large flock at 11 a.m. Bardsey Island, Dec. 20th, 24th, and 26th,
several shot. In the Carlisle District young birds were making for the
coast on the 9th of July.

_Ægialitis hiaticula_, Ringed Plover.--Carlisle District, Aug. 28th,

IRISH COAST.


In the spring of 1884 schedules were forwarded to thirty-six
light-stations. Twenty-seven replied by returning the schedules either
partially, or wholly, filled with observations.

In the autumn a similar number of schedules were sent out, and
twenty-six stations replied.

Several stations filled two, and some light-keepers, who took a special
interest in Ornithology, returned as many as three and four schedules,
both in spring and autumn. Observers placed on isolated rock stations
at a distance from the coast, or on light-vessels, have, as a rule,
taken the most interest in the subject of migration. This is fortunate,
as such stations are least influenced by the local movements of birds
on the mainland.

Observations have now been taken on the Irish coast for three years
and a half, during which period a large body of statistics has been
collected. Their value cannot be questioned; but as the records
accumulate the importance of correctly identifying every species
becomes more apparent. To attain this object the light-keepers were
asked to forward the leg and wing of all birds about which they felt
any doubt. Several wings, &c., have been sent, and a list of them is
subsequently given. In future, it is hoped that the light-keepers will
not think it too much trouble to preserve and label the wings and legs
of _at least one specimen of each kind of bird which is killed at their
station_. This is very desirable, since it cannot be expected that with
so short experience as they have had the light-keepers would be able to
identify all species beyond a doubt.

With the view of still further attaining accuracy of identification,
a request was made to the Commissioners of Irish Lights to supply to
the Lighthouses some copies of the eight-volume edition of Morris's
'British Birds.' The Commissioners very kindly consented to purchase
and distribute six copies, and we are greatly indebted to them for thus
placing in the hands of the light-keepers this useful book, which will
at once assist their observations and relieve the monotony of some
lonely stations. The stations which have received copies of Morris are
the Tuskar, Tearaght, Rathlin, Innishtrahull, Rockabill, and Coningbeg
Light-ship.

Since the volumes have been distributed in the summer of 1884, some
records have appeared in the schedules which are highly improbable.
They appear due to the fact that the bird seen had some slight
resemblance to a rare species figured in Morris. On the other hand, the
coloured figures have been the means of correcting many errors.

The schedules for 1884 exhibit or emphasize the following points:--

In 1884 the number of birds has been equal to, and in a few instances
above, the average.

The bulk of the migrants arrive on the southern half of the east coast
of Ireland, and on the easternmost of our southern counties,--in other
words, along the shore extending from Dublin to Waterford, and having
its limits at Rockabill Lighthouse and Dungarvan Lighthouse.

A _marked_ migratory movement might be expected in our northeastern
counties between Scotland and Ireland, where the Channel is narrowest;
but we have no evidence that such is the case.

The usual course taken by birds seems to be either N.W. or S.E. The
number of birds which only occur singly and do not seem to migrate in
flocks is large. In such instances it is difficult to trace the line of
migration.

The occurrences now noted of the Greenland Falcon, properly belong to
the same flight that has already been noticed in last year's Report.

As might be expected, the Snow Bunting is of more frequent occurrence
on our western and northern coasts. A few remained as late as the first
week in May, and it was again seen early in September, dates which have
not hitherto been recorded in Ireland. Geese were also more numerous on
the northern and western coasts than elsewhere.

A remarkable migration of the Rook was observed at the Tearaght and
Skelligs, both stations being several miles off the coast of Kerry. It
lasted for three weeks, from Nov. 2nd to 20th, the direction of flight
being from west to east. The light-keepers were puzzled to know where
the birds came from, the nearest land to the west being America. [See
general remarks of light-keepers, and also under Rook].

The greatest immigration of Thrushes occurred between the 14th and 20th
of October; Starlings, 18th to 20th October, and the first fortnight
in November; Blackbirds, October 24th; Swallows, about the 12th May.
Whimbrel were more plentiful than usual at our southern stations when
going north in the spring.

The migration of the Starling is perhaps more evident than that of any
other bird; they _strike_ in the greatest numbers. Woodcocks, on the
other hand, usually strike singly; it is a rare occurrence to have more
than one killed on the same night. Very few birds of any kind strike
the lights on the west coast of Ireland.

Sea-birds scarcely ever strike the lanterns. The instances are so few
of birds striking on clear nights, that they do not number half a dozen
per annum.

Some evidence has been given that the Wren is resident on the Tearaght,
Skelligs, and Eagle Islands, all three very bare and isolated rocks on
the west coast; but the specimens received differ in no respect from
the Common Wren of the mainland. The Hedgesparrow was also received
from the Tearaght, and several are stated to have remained there during
last winter.

An interesting observation was made by Mr. McCarron, of the Tearaght,
who watched an old Razorbill dive beneath its young one and rise
exactly underneath it. The young one was thus raised on the back of the
old bird, which carried it in this position over the waves in a rough
sea. This occurrence was witnessed several times.

The transfer of the light-keepers from one station to another is
unavoidable, and changes are made by the Commissioners every year.
There are instances in which one might imagine that the birds had
followed the migration of a particular light-keeper, if he has been a
more careful observer than his predecessor at that station.

We trust the efforts made to enable the birds to be identified will
succeed in time; the various kinds of Gulls are much confused, and the
Puffin, Razorbill, and Guillemot are constantly doing duty for each
other. Redwings, Thrushes, and Fieldfares are not always distinguished;
while Larks, Linnets, and Finches are perhaps too closely associated
in the minds of some light-keepers. By the production of specimens in
future, we trust that some of these difficulties will be removed.

The insertion in the schedules of the column for the _direction_ of
flight has, we think, been of advantage.

Single Hawks appear occasionally with rushes of small birds, perhaps to
capture the disabled ones.

There is one record of Bats being seen at Rockabill, around the light,
the first instance of such an occurrence on the Irish coast.

As our records increase and statistics accumulate, it becomes the more
necessary that the investigation should be continued, so that results
may be confirmed beyond question.

To all the light-keepers who have, again, so kindly given their time
and attention to the subject of migration, we are much indebted. We
feel sure that many are anxious to continue their observations, and
that none who are able will refuse to further our enquiry.

To the Commissioners of Irish Lights, who have supplied six copies
of Morris's 'British Birds' to the light-keepers, and subscribed for
twenty-four copies of the Report, we are under the deepest obligations,
and it is very encouraging to meet with such valuable assistance from a
Public Board whose co-operation is so essential to the success of our
undertaking.

To Mr. Armstrong, the courteous Secretary to the Commissioners, and
to Captain Boxer, R.N., and to Captain Gallway, R.N., our thanks are
especially due.

The foregoing table does not show the relative _numbers_ of birds
striking; it only exhibits the _number of stations_ at which each
species is reported to have struck. For example, the Blackbird is
reported to have struck the glass at nine stations, but hundreds did
so, and were killed or disabled; the Woodcock struck at six stations,
but only seven birds actually struck, all of which were killed outright.

Sea-birds rarely strike, and land-birds seem to strike lighthouses on
islands more than on headlands.

The light-keepers having been requested to forward a leg and wing of
every bird which they were not able to identify with certainty, the
following were received:

  Leg and wing of Ring Ouzel from the Skelligs      shot Sept. 17th.

General Remarks of Light-Keepers.

_Fastnet._--"Spring: The Gannet does not breed on the rock, and never
did; in fact no bird could build, as the rock is too small. There has
been a great scarcity of birds this spring. No birds of any description
seen in June or to 16th July."--James Walsh.

_Old Head, Kinsale._--"Spring: I understand from those fishing off this
head that sea-birds arrive on the fishing grounds from daylight to 10
a.m., always from the eastward. Sky Larks, Titlarks, two Falcon Hawks,
thirty to forty Rock Pigeons, Grey Crows, Kittiwake Gulls, Green and
Black Cormorants, and Sea-pies, are resident here. The Puffin arrives
about 15th April, and leaves 15th Aug. Snipe are always to be found
near a lake three miles away, and Curlew, Wild Duck, Coot, and Waterhen
are there all the year. Autumn: Saw one Rook with white wings in a
flock. Birds very scarce. Not one Golden Plover seen. No bird struck
the lantern."--Martin Kennedy.

_Mine Head._--No reply.

_Coningbeg Light-ship._--"Spring: Great flocks of Puffins pass almost
daily in the summer months from the Saltee Islands, where they breed,
going off during the day and returning in the early morning [? R. M.
B.] about sunrise. Several species of Gull fly off during the day and
return in the evening to the rocks. No Gannets frequent the Saltees,
but Cormorants in great numbers."--Patrick Cullen.

_Tuskar Rock._--"Spring: No birds seen in January but sea-fowl. A
remarkable absence of sea-birds this year. March 25th was the last
day I saw Divers; they generally return in Oct. The young or Black
Gannet have come since the 1st June in small numbers, accompanied by
some white ones. Autumn: I have received the eight volumes of Morris'
'British Birds,' and am sorry to say that all birds heretofore entered
as 'Titmice' were probably Willow or other warblers, and 'Titlarks'
were Rock Pipits. Most of the small land-birds rest on the rock for
about five minutes before flying to shore (seven miles distant). I
enter no sea-birds, as they mostly come and go with fish."--Richard
Hamilton and Patrick D'Arcy.

_Howth Baily._--"Spring: No birds observed migrating. Gulls and Puffins
in vicinity nearly always."--William Dunne.

_Rockabill._--"July 14th. Bats about light all night. Wind light,
S.W."--Joseph Hammond.

[This is the first entry of Bats since the observation commenced on
Irish coast in 1881. Rockabill is five miles from shore on the Dublin
coast.--R. M. B.]

_South Maidens._--"From 1st to 25th March no birds seen except
Seagulls. It is remarkable how few of the birds seen here strike the
lantern glass. From the 30th March to the 23rd April no birds seen here
but the Solan Goose and Seagulls, the former coming from the direction
of Ailsa Craig. During December there were scarcely any land-birds. The
birds commonly found dead after striking the lantern are Blackbirds,
Curlew Larks, and Thrushes."--Michael Barry.

[There is no entry of either a Blackbird or Curlew having been killed
at South Maidens in 1884.--R. M. B.]

_Rathlin Island._--"Spring: Birds were not at all numerous this
season."--John A. Murray.

_Innishtrahull._--"Spring: The following birds breed on this
island:--Titlarks, Sandlarks, Stonechickers (Wheatears), Grey Crows,
and Pigeons. On the out rocks, Seapies and Gulls; and Cormorants on a
rock six miles away."--W. H. James.

_Dunree Head._--"Spring: No birds struck the light for the past six
years. I have never been at a station so scarce of birds of every
description."--John Stapleton.

_Tory Island._--"Spring: Sea-birds first visit this island about 15th
April for breeding, _i.e._, Guillemots, Gulls, Cormorant, Puffin,
Razorbill, and Green Cormorant. Birds of all kinds scarce this year. No
birds struck lantern."--T. H. Sweeny and R. C. Duffy.

_Killybegs._--"A very poor station for birds."--Joseph Hill.

_Eagle Island, East._--"The grass on this island is short and stunted,
and not sufficiently long to afford cover or shelter for birds. I have
not seen or heard any birds strike the lantern. No night migration was
observable on this island. There is not a bush or hedgerow within forty
miles."--Daniel Hawkins.

_Blacksod._--"Very few birds to be seen here. No birds strike the
lantern glass."--Robert W. Redmond.

_Clare Island._--"The birds came to breed in the cliffs a couple of
weeks earlier than usual. From April 20th to end of month, large
numbers of sea-birds continually arrived to breed. The sea-birds that
hatched this summer were very numerous. They will all be taking their
departure by the end of August. During October few birds inhabit the
island, except Grouse, Curlew, Wild Pigeon, Snipe, and a few Woodcocks
and Cormorants; and round the rocks a few Great Northern Divers. The
Eagles did great destruction, killing geese and hens. There are a great
number of Seals in the caves. A boat and crew killed six large ones in
one day in the caves, armed with nothing but heavy sticks. There are a
number of Otters about the cliffs. In stormy weather they come near the
lighthouse. One night in Dec. I heard one barking, and saw him go down
to the sea afterwards."--George H. Brownell.

_Slyne Head, North._--"Very few land birds seen this winter. The
sea-fowl are about the island at all times. The number of birds
striking lantern is less than preceding year."--Robert Tyrrell.

_Arran Island, North._--"During August a great number of Sandlarks,
Sea-pie, Curlew, and Titlarks, remained on island. Puffins, Gannets,
Gulls, and Cormorants flying past occasionally. Redshanks, Sea-pie,
Sandlarks, and Curlew during fine weather remain on island; when rough
they go to the big island of Arran."--Thomas Fortune.

_Straw Island._--"Spring: The following species were never so
scarce:--Gulls, Gannets, Puffins, and Sea-pies. I have never seen so
few birds early in spring, but as the spring advanced the numbers of
Linnets, Fieldlarks, Stonechats, and Yellowhammers increased so much
that I have not seen such numbers for many years past. The different
species of Gull and Cormorant remain throughout the year; they breed
on the cliffs on the large island of Arran. No birds ever strike this
lantern, the light being red, and not showing in the direction of the
general flight of birds. Autumn: I have noticed fewer birds than usual.
The Cormorant, White-backed Gull, and Royal Gull are the only species
remaining during the winter. A number of small birds, such as Thrushes,
Blackbirds, Starling, Linnets, &c., frequently fly from the mainland,
especially in severe weather. All through the autumn to the present
(Dec. 30th) I have remarked flights of wild Duck and Barnacle going
N.E."--Charles Boyle.

_Tearaght._--"I heard the Manx Shearwater for the first time this year
on the night of April 10th, but as usual the note ceased after the moon
rose. I have not seen any of the 'Mackerel Cock' since March 29th. [A
specimen of 'Mackerel Cock' sent Jan., 1885, was a young Razorbill
in winter plumage.--R. M. B.] Birds remaining on the island on July
31st:--Sea-parrots, Razorbills, Guillemots (only a few), Kittiwakes,
Royal Gulls, and the large White Gulls, Stormy Petrels, Sea-pies,
Choughs, and Hooded Crows. Birds remaining Jan. 15th, 1885:--Razorbills
(young), Kittiwakes (old), _Royal Gulls_, _Herring Gulls_ (young
and old), _Chough_, _Hooded Crow_, _Wrens_, Titlarks, _Rock Pipit_,
_Peregrine Falcon_, _Sparrow-Hawk_, Mountain Linnet (Twite), Gannets,
Chaffinch, Greenfinch, Rock Pigeon, and Cormorants. Those in italics
are always here. The Herring Gull was called previously 'large white
Gull.' I wish to draw special attention to the great number of 'Crows'
which passed over this island from the 5th to the 25th Nov. They were
flying at a height of seven or eight hundred feet. When passing this
island their flight would become irregular. Some rested for a little
while, and a few were to be seen some days afterwards having a tired
appearance." [I expressed a doubt about the identification of the
species to Mr. McCarron.--R. M. B.] He then wrote:--"I was standing
within ten paces of one several minutes, and it had not the excrescence
round the base of bill, and I think I am correct in saying it was not
the Rook." [Neither Mr. More nor myself have ever seen a freshly killed
Irish specimen of the Carrion Crow. In the 3rd 'Report on Migration,'
p. 86, large flights of Rooks coming from the sea in a S.W. direction
are mentioned as occurring at Blackrock Lighthouse, nine miles off
Mayo.--R. M. B.]


Eagle.

_Clare Island._--April 4th, a young speckled Eagle perched at noon on
a pinnacle of cliff about two hundred yards from lighthouse, then went
to its eyrie in the highest cliffs. The two Eagles are here still in
their usual abode in the highest cliffs. Nov. 20th, large Eagle close
to station.

_Tearaght._--Jan. 16th, 1885, one passed from E. in front of dwellings,
and round west of island, when it rose to a great height and moved
steadily N.E. towards mainland, accompanied for some distance by three
Choughs and a Peregrine Falcon, which appeared mere specks beside it.
Frost and snow on Kerry mountains.


Greenland Falcon.

_Blackrock, Mayo._--March 10th, one Greenland Falcon about all day;
wind S.W., strong, snow showers. The Falcon was shot, and was much
smaller than the other one, only in better condition. [The "other one"
probably refers to the specimen entered in the schedule for 1883; see
5th Report, p. 90.--R. M. B.]

_Tearaght._--March 23rd, one Greenland Falcon shot 10 a.m.; wind S.,
light, clear; length from tips of wings, 48½ inches; from beak to
tail, 22 inches; weight, 3 lbs. 6. oz. March 24th, one seen to-day
devouring a sea-parrot. April 2nd, one shot, smaller and whiter than
the bird killed on March 23rd. April 7th, two to-day, each time pursued
by Crows. April 21st, a very large one pounced upon a sea-parrot and
carried it off to an adjoining island. [The specimens killed on March
23rd and April 2nd were recorded in Report for 1883.--R. M. B.]

The four birds are at the station stuffed; they are like the Snow
Bunting, but quite black on the back, with a greenish tinge and white
breast. The two birds arrived after the Snow Buntings had left." [Two
of the specimens alluded to were kindly forwarded by Mr. Williams, and
turned out to be Snow Buntings in almost full summer attire. The first
week in May is very early for the summer plumage to be so far advanced,
and the occurrence of the Snow Bunting in Ireland in May is very

S.E.; wind high, W. April 17th, flocks of Sea-parrots alighted on rock
in great numbers. [In this and in other cases the name "Puffin" would
seem to have been applied either to the Guillemot or Razorbill, and
Sea-Parrot to the true Puffin.--R. M. B.]

_Straw Island._--April 19th, twenty Puffins; remained about lighthouse.

_Tearaght._--March 23rd, Sea-parrots arrived at 4 p.m., wind light,
clear; 24th, great numbers came on island; 26th, Sea-parrots entirely
disappeared until the 29th, when they returned; or perhaps they were
new arrivals. They are as plentiful this year as last, and arrived one
week earlier. [See general remarks under Clare Island.--R. M. B.] I
found a nest with one egg on 11th May, and on 11th June it was hatched,
the time occupied being one month. It is in the night-time all the
young birds leave their holes and go to the sea, and once there they
are no more to be seen. I never saw any of them on the wing or on the
water. They never leave the holes until they take their departure, and
then they go tumbling and rolling to the sea. There is no trace of this
first stage of migration to be observed next morning, except sometimes
in their outward course an odd one tumbles into our yards, where they
are found. I was roused up one night at 2 a.m. by one trying to get up
stairs; it was nearly at the top when I saw it. Puffins left in a great
body on Aug. 1st; number on island diminishing until Aug. 15th, when
the last was seen.

_Rathlin Island._--April 6th, flocks resting on the sea. Aug. 22nd,
Razorbills leaving island.

_Blackrock, Mayo._--April 30th, Razorbills all day; wind fresh, W.

_Clare Island._--March 21st, about fifty "Razorbill-puffins"; 25th,
Puffins (Razorbills?) in large numbers.

_Tearaght._--March 23rd, Razorbills arrived. May 7th, came on island as
plentiful as in previous years. About this date (July 31st) both old
and young are mostly gone. During the past fortnight both old and young
could be heard on the water at night. A few evenings ago I observed a
young bird crying on the water; the old one was soon beside it, both
going seaward, when the old bird made a little dive, and rose exactly
under the young one, so that it was nicely poised on its back. In
this way both headed the waves, and were lost in the distance. On the
following evenings I kept a good look out, and saw several instances
of the same kind; and on no occasion did I observe the young birds to
fall off, though the sea was pretty rough. Last seen on Aug. 14th.
Sept. 16th, two old and two young appeared, swimming S. Dec. 7th, young
Razorbills; wind W.; very strong, high sea. As many as two or three
hundred may be seen almost every day, especially in stormy weather.
Having procured a specimen of the bird I called a "Mackerel-cock"
(see fifth Report, pp. 89 and 128), I find it is the young Razorbill.
[Specimen sent.--R. M. B.; shot, 13th, Jan., 1885.] It comes here every
winter, and not a single old bird is to be found amongst them; nor one
of them among the old birds in summer.

_Skelligs._--March 20th, Razorbills first seen on rock. July 20th,
noticed young fledged Razorbills leaving rock. Aug. 5th, all left, with
one or two exceptions. Nov. 27th, great numbers of the "Black-billed
Auk"; noticed flights of them for the past fortnight, flying S.,
mostly in the afternoon. They left on 2nd March, 1885, except one
or two, seen on 16th inst. They only come close to the rock in wild
weather. In my former report I called this bird the Razorbill; but it
answers the description of the Black-billed Auk, in the 'Dictionary of
British Birds.' [Doubtless the young Razorbill, which was erroneously
regarded as a species under the title of "Black-billed Auk" by Colonel
Montagu.--R. M. B.] December, a great number of "Black-billed Auks"
fishing.

_Tearaght._--May 18th, Stormy Petrels arrived on this date, or perhaps
previous to it; plentiful on 23rd. Eggs taken on June 19th. Will lay
the third egg if the others are taken. They are very plentiful this
year, but are never seen in the daytime, but at night continually
striking the glass. They are not very welcome visitors, owing to the
blotches of oil they eject on the glass and balcony. They are so
plentiful skimming about that they often come close to a person's ears.
They are to be heard in every bank, under every rock, and in every
crevice. On dark calm nights the air as well as the rocks and banks is
filled with their music; their hatching is not over until August is
well advanced. Sept. 15th, one (young) caught on balcony. Oct. 11th,
one going S.W.; wind N., showery. Nov. 15th, one on lantern.

_Skelligs._--May 25th, heard the Stormy Petrel under the stones to-day
for the first time this year. June 2nd, several Stormy Petrels about
lantern; drizzling rain. During foggy and rainy nights in July and

APPENDIX.


Mr. Gurney has received a batch of wings from the Leman and Ower
L.V. off Cromer, taken from birds evidently killed last autumn;
unfortunately they are not dated, so that much of their value as a
record of migration is lost. They include Willow Wren, Wheatear, Snipe,
Jack Snipe, Ring Dotterel, Robin, Sedge Warbler, Redstart, Fieldfare
(three), Thrush, Blackbird, Titlark (five), Sky Lark, Chaffinch
(three), Great Tit, Goldcrest, Reed Bunting, Wood Pigeon, Woodcock
(two), Starling, Swallow, Martin, Sanderling, Tree Sparrow.

Pied Flycatcher.--With reference to Mr. J. Harvie Brown's remarks (see
foot-note, p. 100 of Report) on the arrival of Pied Flycatchers at
the Isle of May and Pentland Skerries in the first week in May, 1885,
it is interesting to learn that the same species is also reported in
great numbers from Flamborough and Spurn at the same period, _viz._,
the first week in May; it was also observed in Norfolk on the 9th. At
Flamborough, as Mr. Bailey informed me, a great many came in on the
3rd, with a N.E. wind, and in company with male Redstarts. At Spurn,
Mr. P. W. Lawton states that it has been more numerous than he ever
before knew it. ('Naturalist,' June 1885, p. 250, foot-note).

Transcriber Note

Erratum on p. 71 has been corrected. There were several superscripted
numbers (pp. 41, 55, 64 and 73) which are interpreted as wind speeds
and so the superscripting was removed. The footnote on page 112 was
moved from the first listed species to the title as the footnote relates
to the order of the species. Minor typos have been corrected. Some
inconsistencies in spelling have been left as printed.
